  <h1 class='c004'>SOUTH AMERICAN JUNGLE TALES</h1>
</div>

<div>
  <h2 id='st1' class='c005'>HOW THE RAYS DEFENDED THE FORD</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In South America there is a river called the
Yabebirì; and it flows through the city of
Misiones. In this river there are many rays,
a kind of mud fish like the salt-water skate;
and the river, indeed, gets its name from them:
“Yabebirì” means the “river of ray fish.”
The ray is a wide, flat fish with a long, slender
tail. The tail is very bony; and when it
strikes you it cuts, and leaves poison in the
wound.</p>

<p class='c007'>There are so many rays in the river that it
is dangerous even to put your foot into the
water. I once knew a man who had his heel
pricked by a ray. He had to walk more
than two miles home, groaning with pain all
the way and fainting several times from the
poison. The pain from a ray bite is one of
the sharpest pains one can feel.</p>

<p class='c007'>But there are also other kinds of fish in the
Yabebirì; and most of them are good to eat.
That is why some evil men once began to fish
for them with dynamite. They put the dynamite
under water and set it off. The shock
of the explosion stunned and killed all the
fish nearby; and not only the big fish, but
also the little ones, which cannot be eaten.
It is very cruel and wasteful to hunt fish with
dynamite.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, there was a man who lived on the
bank of the river; and he was sorry for the
poor fish, especially the little ones; and he
told the bad men that they must stop bombing
the fish. At first they were angry and
said they would do what they liked. But
the man was known everywhere to be an
upright, honest man, and finally they obeyed
him and set off no more bombs in the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the fish were grateful to this man,
whom they had come to know the moment
he approached the edge of the water. Whenever
he walked along the bank smoking his
pipe, the rays especially would swim along
the bottom to keep him company. He, of
course, did not know he had so many friends in
the river. He lived there just because he
liked the place.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, it happened one afternoon that a fox
came running down to the river; and putting
his forepaws into the water he called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey there, you ray fish! Quick! Quick!
Here comes that friend of yours! He’s in
trouble!”</p>

<p class='c007'>All the rays who heard came swimming up
anxiously to the edge of the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter? Where is he?” they
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here he comes!” answered the fox. “He
has been fighting with a panther, and is trying
to get away! He wants to get over to that
island! Let him cross, for he is a very good
man!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course we will! Of course we will!” the
rays answered. “As for the panther, we will
fix him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but remember a panther is a
panther!” said the fox; by which he meant
that a panther is almost as hard to fight
with as a tiger. And the fox gave a little jump
and ran back into the woods, so as not to be
near when the panther came.</p>

<p class='c007'>A second or two later, the branches along
the river bank were pushed aside, and the
man came running down to the water’s edge.
He was all bleeding and his shirt was torn.
From a scratch on his face the blood was
streaming down off his chin, and his sleeves
were wet with blood also. It was clear that
the man was very badly hurt; for he almost
fell as he ran out into the river. When he
put his feet into the water, the rays moved
aside so that their tails would not touch
him; and he waded across to the island, with
the water coming up to his breast. On the
other side he fell to the ground fainting from
loss of blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rays did not have much time to sit
there pitying him. Some distance behind
the man the panther came jumping along
with great leaps to catch him. The big
wildcat stopped on the bank, and gave a
great roar; but up and down the river the
rays went calling; “The Panther! The Panther!”
and they gathered together near the
shore to attack him if he tried to cross.</p>

<p class='c007'>The panther looked up and down the
stream, and finally he spied the man lying
helpless on the island. He, too, was badly
wounded and dripping with blood; but he
was determined to eat the man at any cost.
With another great howl, he leaped into the
water.</p>

<p class='c007'>Almost instantly, however, he felt as though
a hundred pins and needles were sticking
into his paws. You see, the rays were trying
to block the ford, and were stinging him with
the stingers in their tails. He gave one big
jump back to the river bank and stood there
roaring, and holding one paw up in the air
because it hurt him to step on it. After a
moment he looked down into the water and
saw that it was all black and muddy. The
rays were coming in great crowds and stirring
up the bottom of the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah hah!” said the panther: “Ah hah! I
see! It is you, you bad, wicked ray fish! It
was you who gave me all those stings! Well
now, just get out of the way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We will not get out of the way,” answered
the rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Away, I tell you!” said the panther.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We won’t!” said the rays. “He is a
good man. It is not right to kill him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He gave me these wounds you see,”
said the panther. “I must punish him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you gave him his wounds, too,”
said the rays. “But that is all a matter for
you folks in the woods to settle. So long as
this man is on the river, he is in our province
and we intend to protect him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get out of my way!” said the panther.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not never!” said the rays. You see,
the rays had never been to school; and they
said “not never” and “not nothing” the
way children sometimes do and never ought
to do, not never!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we’ll see!” said the panther, with
another great roar; and he ran up the bank
to get a start for one great jump. The
panther understood that the rays were packed
close in along the shore; and he figured that
if he could jump away out into the stream
he would get beyond them and their stingers,
and finally reach the wounded man on the
island.</p>

<p class='c007'>But some of the rays saw what he was going
to do, and they began to shout to one another:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Out to mid-stream! Out to mid-stream!
He’s going to jump! He’s going to jump!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The panther did succeed in making a very
long leap, and for some seconds after he
struck the water he felt no pain. He gave a
great roar of delight, thinking he had deceived
his enemies. But then, all of a sudden, sting
here and sting there, in front, in back, on his
sides! The rays were upon him again, driving
their poisonous stingers into his skin. For a
moment, the panther thought it was as easy to
go forward as back, and he kept on. But the
rays were now all over along the island;
so the panther turned and went back to
the shore he had left.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was now about done. He just had to
lie down on his side to keep the bottoms of
his feet off the ground; and his stomach went
up and down as he breathed deeply from
fatigue and pain. He was growing dizzy,
also, because the poison from the stings was
getting into his brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rays were not satisfied, however. They
kept crowding up along the shore because
they knew that panthers never go alone,
but always with a mate. This mate would
come, and they would again have to defend
the ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so it was. Soon the she-panther came
down roaring through the bushes to rescue
her husband. She looked across to the island
where the man was lying wounded; and then
at her mate, who lay there panting at her
feet; and then down into the water, which
was black with rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ray fish!” she called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, madam?” answered the rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me cross the river!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No crossing here for panthers!” said the
rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll bite the tails off every one of you!”
said the she-panther.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Even without our tails, we won’t let you
cross!” said the rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>“For the last time, out of my way!” said
the she-panther.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not never!” said the rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>The she-panther now put one foot into the
water; but a ray struck at her with its
stinger, and made a sting right between two
of her toes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oooouch!” growled the she-panther.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have at least one tail left!” mocked
the rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the she-panther began to scowl now.
When panthers are thinking very hard they
scowl. This one scowled her face into deep
wrinkles; which meant that she had a very
important idea. She did not let on what it
was, however. She just trotted off up the
bank into the woods without saying another
word.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the rays understood what she was up
to. She was going to some place farther
along the stream where there were no rays
and would swim across before they could
reach her. And a great fright came over
them. Rays cannot swim very fast, and they
knew that the she-panther would get there
before they did.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, oh!” they cried to each other. “Now
our poor man-friend is done for. How can
we let the rays down there know we must
prevent the panther from crossing at any
cost?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But a little ray, who was a very bright and
clever little fish, spoke up and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get the shiners to carry a message!
Shiners can swim like lightning; and they
too ought to be grateful to the man for
stopping those bombs!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s it! That’s it! Let’s send the
shiners!”</p>

<p class='c007'>A school of shiners happened to be just
going by; and the rays sent them off with a
message to all the rays along the river:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sting the she-panther if she tries to cross!
Hold the ford against the she-panther!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Though the shiners swam very, very fast,
they were barely in time. The panther was
already in the water, and had begun to swim
out beyond her depth. In fact, she was
almost over on the other side toward the
island. But when her paws struck bottom
and she began to wade again, the rays were
on hand. They rushed in packs upon her
legs and feet, stinging them with tens, hundreds,
thousands of stings. At the same
time more rays crowded in between the
panther and the shore. Roaring with pain
and anger, she finally swam back to the place
where she had jumped in, and rolled about
on the ground in agony. When she came
back to where her husband was lying, her
paws and legs were all swollen from the
poison.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rays, for their part, were getting very
tired from all this stinging and hurrying to
and fro. And they were not much relieved
when they saw the panther and the she-panther
get up all of a sudden and go off
into the woods. What were they up to now?
The rays were very much worried, and they
gathered together in council.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know what I think?” said the
oldest ray. “I think they have gone off to
get all the other panthers. When they come
back, they will be too much for us and they
will surely get across!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is so!” said the other rays, the older
and more experienced ones. “At least one
or two will get across. That will be the end
of our friend, the man! Suppose we go and
have a talk with him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>For the first time they now went over to
where the man was lying. They had been too
busy up to then to think of him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man had lost a great deal of blood, and
was still lying on the ground; but he was able
to sit up enough to talk. The rays told him
how they had been defending the ford against
the panthers who had been trying to eat him.
The man could hardly keep in his tears as he
thought of the friendship these fishes had
for him. He thanked them by reaching out
his hand and stroking the nearest ones on
the nose. But then he moaned:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas! You cannot save me! When the
panthers come back there will be many of
them; and if they want to get across they
can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No they can’t,” said a little ray. “No
they can’t! Nobody but a friend of ours can
cross this ford!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid they will be too much for
you,” said the man sadly. After a moment’s
thought he added:</p>

<p class='c007'>“There might be one way to stop them.
If there were someone to go and get my
rifle ... I have a Winchester, with a box of
bullets ... but the only friends I have near
here are fish ... and fish can’t bring me a
rifle!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well...?” asked the rays anxiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes ... yes ...” said the man, rubbing
his forehead with his right hand, as though
trying to collect his thoughts. “Let’s see....
Once I had a friend, a river hog, whom I
tamed and kept in my house to play with my
children. One day he got homesick and went
back to the woods to live. I don’t know
what became of him ... but I think he came
to this neighborhood!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The rays gave one great shout of joy:</p>

<p class='c007'>“We know him! We know him! He
lives in the cave just below here in the river
bank. We remember now that he once told
us he knew you very well. We will send him
to get the rifle.”</p>

<p class='c007'>No sooner said than done! A shiner, who
was the fastest swimmer in his school, started
off down the river to where the river hog
lived. It was not far away; and before long
the river hog came up on the bank across
the river. The man picked up a fishbone from
the ground near him; and dipping it in some
blood that was on his hand wrote on a dry
leaf this letter to his wife:</p>

<p class='c008'>“Dear Wife: Send me my Winchester by
this river hog, with a full box of a hundred
bullets.</p>

<div class='c009'>(Signed) The Man.”</div>

<p class='c010'>He was just finishing the letter when the
whole river valley began to tremble with the
most frightful roars. The panthers were coming
back in a large company to force a crossing
and devour their enemy. Quickly two rays
stuck their heads out of the water. The man
handed them the leaf with the letter written
on it; and holding it up clear of the water,
they swam over to where the river hog was.
He took it in his mouth and ran off as fast
as he could toward the man’s house.</p>

<p class='c007'>And he had no time to lose. The roaring
was now very close to the river and every
moment it was getting nearer. The rays
called anxiously to the shiners, who were
hovering in the water nearby waiting for
orders:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quick, shiners! Swim up and down the
river, and give a general alarm! Have all
the rays gather about the island on every
side! We will see whether these panthers
get across!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And up and down the river the shiners
darted, streaking the surface with tiny black
wakes, so fast did they move. The rays
began coming out from the mud, from under
the stones, from the mouths of the brooks,
from all along the river. They assembled in
solid masses, almost, around the island, bent
on keeping the panthers back at whatever
cost. And meanwhile the shiners came streaming
up and down past the island, raising
new recruits and ready to give the word when
the panthers appeared.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the panthers did appear, at last.
With a great roar an army of them came
leaping down to the river bank. There were
a hundred of them, perhaps; at least all the
panthers in the woods around Misiones. But,
on the other hand, the river was now packed
with rays, who were ready to die, rather than
let a single panther across.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get out of our way!” roared the panthers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No trespassing on this river!” said the
rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gangway!” called the panthers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep out!” said the rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you don’t get out of the way, we will
eat every ray, and every son of a ray, and
every grandson of a ray, not counting the
women and children!” said the panthers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps,” said the rays; “but no
panther, nor any son, grandson, daughter,
granddaughter, sister, brother, wife, aunt
or uncle of a panther will ever get across this
ford!</p>

<p class='c007'>“For one last time, get out of the way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not never!” said the rays.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the battle began.</p>

<p class='c007'>With enormous bounds and jumps and
leaps, the panthers plunged into the river.
But they landed on an almost solid floor of
ray fish. The rays plunged their stingers
into the panthers’ feet, and at each prick the
panthers would send up the most bloodcurdling roars.
Meanwhile the panthers were
clawing and kicking at the rays, making
frightful splashes in the water and tossing
up ray fish by the barrel full. Hundreds and
hundreds of rays were caught and torn by the
panthers’ claws, and went floating down the
Yabebirì, which was soon all tinged with
ray blood. But the panthers were getting
terribly stung, too; and many of them had
to go back to the shore, where they lay roaring
and whining, holding their swollen paws up in
the air. Though many more of the rays were
being trampled on, and scratched and bitten,
they held their ground. Sometimes when a
ray had been tossed into the air by a panther’s
paw, he would return to the fight after he had
fallen back into the water.</p>

<p class='c007'>The combat had now lasted as long as half
an hour. By that time the panthers were
tired out and had gone back to the shore
they came from, where they sat down to
rest and to lick the stings on their paws.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not one of them had been able to cross the
ford, however. But the rays were in a terrible
plight. Thousands of them had been killed;
and those that still remained were about
tired to death.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We cannot stand a second attack like
this one,” said the rays. “Hey, shiners!
Go up and down the river again, and bring
us reenforcements! We must have every single
last ray there is in the Yabebirì!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And again the shiners were off up and down
the river, flecking the surface of the water
with the wakes they left. The rays now
thought they should consult the man again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We cannot hold out much longer!” said
the rays. And some of them actually wept
for the poor man who was going to be eaten
by the panthers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind, please, my dear little rays!”
answered the man. “You have done enough
for me! It’s a pity that any more of you
should die. Now you had better let the
panthers come across.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not never!” cried the rays. “So long
as there is a ray left alive, we shall defend the
man who defended us and saved our lives from
the bombers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear friends,” said the man in reply,
“I think I am bound to die anyway, I am so
badly wounded. But I can promise you that
when that Winchester arrives, you will see some
exciting things. That much I am sure of!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, we know! We know!” said the
rays. But they could not continue the conversation:
the battle was on again. The
panthers had now rested, and were crouching
all on the river bank, ready to take off with
great leaps and bounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll give you one last chance!” they
called to the rays. “Now be reasonable!
Get out of our way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not never!” said the rays, crowding up
close along the shore in front of the panthers.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a flash, the panthers were in the water
again, and the same terrible fight as before
was taking place. The Yabebirì from shore
to shore was one mass of bloody foam. Hundreds
and hundreds of rays were tossed into
the air, while the panthers bellowed from
the pain in their paws. But not a panther
and not a ray gave an inch of ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, the panthers were little by little
forcing their way forward. In vain the shiners
darted up and down the river calling in more
and more rays to battle. There were no
rays left anywhere along the stream. Every
last ray was either fighting desperately in the
army around the island, or was floating
bruised and bleeding down the current. Such
as were still left were all but helpless from the
fatigue of their great efforts.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now they realized that the battle was
lost. Five of the biggest panthers had broken
through the lines of the rays, and were
swimming through clear water straight toward the
island. The poor rays decided they would
rather die than see their poor friend eaten by
the panthers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Retreat to the island!” they called to
each other. “Back to the island!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But this was too late, alas. Two more
panthers had now broken through the line;
and when the rays started for the island,
every last panther on the shore jumped into
the water and made for the wounded man.
Ten, twenty, fifty, perhaps a hundred panthers
could be seen swimming with just their heads
out of water.</p>

<p class='c007'>But what was that down there? The rays
had been so busy fighting they had not
noticed before. From a point on the shore
some distance below the ford a brown, fuzzy
animal had gone into the water, and had
been swimming all this time toward the
island. It was the river hog, paddling
along as fast as he could with his head and
neck out of the water and the Winchester in
his mouth. He was holding his head away
up like that to keep the rifle dry. On the
end of the rifle hung the man’s cartridge belt,
full of bullets.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man gave a great cry of joy; for the
river hog was quite a distance ahead of the
panthers, and he would be ashore by the time
they began to wade again. And the river
hog did get there in no time. The man was
too weak to move much; so the river hog
pulled him around by the collar so that he
lay facing the panthers. In this position the
man loaded the rifle and took aim.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rays, meanwhile, were heart broken.
Crushed, scratched, bruised, bleeding, worn
out from struggling, they saw that they had
lost the battle. The panthers were almost
over to the island. In a few moments their
friend would be eaten alive!</p>

<p class='c007'>C-r-r-ack! C-r-r-r-ack! Bing! Bing. The rays
who had their eyes out of water suddenly
saw a panther, who was just coming up out
of the river toward the man, give a great leap
into the air and fall back to the ground in
a heap.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rays understood! “Hoo-ray! Hoo-ray
Hoo-ray!” shouted the rays. “The man has
the rifle! He is saved! We have won!” And
they dirtied all the water, so much mud did
they stir up by the dancing they started on
the bottom of the river. C-r-r-r-ack!
C-r-r-ack! Bing-g-g! Bing-g-g! The rifle kept
going off and the bullets kept singing through
the air. At each shot a panther fell dead on
the sand or sank drowning under the water.
The shooting did not last more than a minute
and a half, however. After ten or a dozen
panthers had been killed, the others swam
back to the opposite shore and ran off into
the woods.</p>

<p class='c007'>The panthers that were killed in the water,
sank to the bottom where the horn-pouts
ate them. Others kept afloat, and the shiners
went down the Yabebirì with them, all the
way to the Parana, having a great feast off
panther meat, and jumping and hopping
along the top of the water to express their
delight. When the friends of the wounded
man came to get him, they skinned the
panthers that were lying on the shore; and
the man’s wife had a set of new rugs for her
dining room.</p>

<p class='c007'>Soon the man got well again. And the
rays, who have a great many children each
year, were as numerous as ever after one
season. The man was so grateful for what
they had done in trying to save his life, that
he built a bungalow on the island and went
there to live during his vacations. On nights
in summer, when the moon was shining, he
would go out in front of his bungalow and sit
down on a rock over the water to smoke his
pipe. The rays would creep up softly over
the bottom and point him out to fish who
did not know him. “There he is, see? The
panthers came across over here; we stood in
line over there. And when the panthers
broke through, the man took his rifle,
and....”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='st2' class='c011'>THE STORY OF TWO RACCOON CUBS AND TWO MAN CUBS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Once there was a mother raccoon who had
three cubs; they all lived in the woods eating
fruits and berries and birds’ eggs. Whenever
they were on a tree top and heard a noise,
they would jump head foremost to the ground
and scamper off with their tails in the air.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when the cubs had grown to be
quite large sized raccoons, their mother took
them up all together to the top of an orange
tree&mdash;you must know that in South America
orange trees, which came originally from
Spain, now grow wild in the forest&mdash;and spoke
to them as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cublets, you are almost big enough to be
called raccoons; and it is time you began to
hunt for your meals by yourselves. It is very
important for you to know how to do this,
because, when you get to be old, you will go
around all alone in the world, as all raccoons
do. The oldest of you likes snails and cockroaches.
He must hunt around woodpiles
and under trunks of rotting trees, where
there are always plenty of snails and cockroaches.
The next to the oldest of you seems
to like oranges. Up to the month of December
there will be plenty of oranges right here in
this grove. The youngest of you is always
asking for birds’ eggs. Well, there are birds’
nests everywhere. All he will have to do is
hunt. But one thing, however: he must
never go down to the farm looking for eggs.
It is very bad for raccoons to go near farms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cublets, there is one thing more you
must all be afraid of: dogs! dogs! Never go
near a dog! Once I had a fight with a dog.
Do you see this broken tooth? Well, I broke
it in a fight with a dog! And so I know what
I am talking about! And behind dogs come
people, with guns, and the guns make a great
noise, and kill raccoons. Whenever you hear
a dog, or a man, or a gun, jump for your lives
no matter how high the tree is, and run, run,
run! If you don’t they will kill you as sure
as preaching!”</p>

<p class='c007'>That is what the mother raccoon said to
her cublets. Whereupon, they all got down
from the tree top, and went each his own way,
nosing about in the leaves from right to left
and from left to right, as though they were
looking for something they had lost. For
that is the way raccoons hunt.</p>

<p class='c007'>The biggest of the cubs, who liked snails and
cockroaches, looked under every piece of dead
wood he came to and overturned the piles of
dead leaves. Soon he had eaten such a fine
meal that he grew sleepy and lay down in a
nice cozy bed of leaves and went to sleep. The
second one, who liked oranges, did not move
from that very grove. He just went from
one tree to another eating the best oranges;
and he did not have to jump from a tree top
once; for neither men, nor dogs, nor guns,
came anywhere near him.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the youngest, who would have nothing
but birds’ eggs, had a harder time of it. He
hunted and hunted over the hillsides all day
long and found only two birds’ nests&mdash;one
belonging to a toucan, with three eggs in it,
and the other belonging to a wood dove, with
two eggs in it. Five tiny little eggs! That
was not very much to eat for a raccoon almost
big enough to go to school. When evening
came the little cub was as hungry as he had
been that morning; and he sat down, all cold
and tired and lonesome, on the very edge of
the forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the place where he was sitting he
could look down on the green fields of the
farm, and he thought of what his mother had
said about such places.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, why did mamma say that? Why
shouldn’t I go looking for eggs down along
those fences on the farm?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And just as he was saying this all to himself,
what should he hear but the song of a strange
bird: “Cock-a-doodle-doo-oo-oo”; coming
from far, far away and from the direction of
the farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My, did you ever hear a bird sing so
loud?” said the cublet to himself. “What
a big bird it must be! And its eggs must be
the size of a cocoanut!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cock-a-doodle-doo-oo-oo,” came the bird’s
song again. The hungry little raccoon just
couldn’t do without one of those eggs the size
of a cocoanut. The bird was singing somewhere
off to the right. So he made a short
cut through the woods toward the field on the
other side.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun was setting, but the raccoon cub
ran with his tail in the air. At last he came
to the edge of the woods, and looked down
again into the fields.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Cock-a-doodle-doo-oo-oo!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Not far away now he could see the farmhouse.
There was a man in the yard. The
man was wearing long boots, and leading a
horse by the bridle into a barn. On the
fence in the barnyard, the little raccoon saw
his bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a silly little ’coon I am,” he said to
himself. “That isn’t a bird! That’s a rooster!
Mamma showed him to me one day, when
we were on top of a big tree up in the woods.
Roosters have a fine song; and they have a
great many hens that lay sweet eggs. I
think I could eat a dozen of those eggs, right
now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>For some time the little raccoon sat looking
at the rooster and the barn and the farmhouse,
and thinking of what his mother had
said. But at last he thought: “Mamma is
far away! She will never know”; and he
made up his mind that as soon as it was
dark he would run down to that hen coop
and see what he could find.</p>

<p class='c007'>Before long the sun had gone completely
and it was so dark you could hardly see your
hand before your face. Walking on tiptoe,
the little raccoon came out from the shadow
of the woods, and began making his way toward
the farmhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>When he got into the yard, he stopped and
listened carefully. Not a sound! The little
raccoon was as happy as could be: he was
going to eat a hundred, a thousand, two
thousand of those eggs! He looked around
for the hen coop. There it was! He stole up
to the door and peered in.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the ground, and right in front of the
door, what should he see but an egg? And
such a large egg! If it was not as big as a
cocoanut, it was at least as big as an orange!
And how brightly it shone in the dark!
“Guess I’ll keep that egg for dessert,” thought
the cub for a moment. But his mouth began
to water and water, and he simply couldn’t
wait. He stepped up and put his front teeth
into that egg. But&mdash;</p>

<p class='c007'>Trac-c-c!</p>

<p class='c007'>He had hardly touched it when there was a
sharp snapping noise. The little raccoon
felt a hard blow strike him in the face,
while a stinging pain caught him in his right
forepaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma! Mamma!” he called, jumping
wildly this way and that. But he could not
get his foot loose. He was caught in a trap!
And just at that moment a dog began to
bark!</p>

<p class='c007'>All that time when the little raccoon had
been waiting in the woods for night to come,
so that he could go down to get his eggs in the
hen coop, the man who owned the farmhouse
had been playing with his children on
the lawn in the yard. One of them was a
little girl five years old; and the other was a
little boy six years old. Both had golden
hair. They were chasing their father about
and falling down every so often on the grass.
Then they would get up again and run some
more. The man would also pretend to fall
and the three of them were having a splendid
time.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it grew dark, the man said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now let’s go and set our trap in the hen
coop, so that if the weasel comes to-night to
kill our chickens and eat our eggs, we will
catch him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went and set the trap. Then the
family had dinner, and the little boy and the
little girl were put to bed.</p>

<p class='c007'>But they were both very much excited about
the trap and the weasel. They could not
sleep. Finally they sat up in their beds and
began to throw pillows at each other. Their
father and mother were reading down in the
dining room. They heard what the children
were doing; but they said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly the pillow-throwing stopped; and
after a moment the little boy called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa! Papa! The weasel is in the trap.
Don’t you hear Tuké barking? Let us go
too, papa!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tuké, you see, was the name of the dog!</p>

<p class='c007'>Their father said they might, provided
they put their shoes on. He would never let
them go out at night, barefooted, for fear of
coral or rattlesnakes.</p>

<p class='c007'>So they went in their pajamas, just as they
were.</p>

<p class='c007'>And what, if you please, did they find in the
trap? Their father stooped down in the
doorway of the hen coop, holding Tuké back by the
collar. When he stood up, he was holding a
little raccoon by the tail; and the little raccoon
was snapping and whistling and screaming
“Mamma! Mamma!” in a sharp, shrill
voice like a cricket’s.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, don’t kill him, papa! He is such a
pretty little ’coon!” said the boy and the
girl. “Give him to us, and we will tame him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” said the father. “You may
have him. But don’t forget that raccoons
drink water when they are thirsty, the same
as little boys and girls.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He said this because once he had caught a
wildcat and given it to them for a pet. They
fed it plenty of meat from the pantry. But
they didn’t dream that it needed water. And
the poor wildcat died.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cage where the wildcat had been kept
was still standing near the hen coop. They
put the raccoon into the cage, and went back
into the house. This time, when they went
to bed, they fell fast asleep at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>About midnight, when everything was still,
the little raccoon, who had a very sore foot
from the cuts made in it by the teeth of the
trap, saw three shadows come creeping up
toward his cage; for the moon was now
shining faintly. They came closer and closer,
moving softly and noiselessly over the ground.
His heart gave a great leap when he discovered
that it was his mother and his two
brothers, who had been looking for him everywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma! Mamma!” he began to cry
from his cage, but soft-like, so as not to wake
up the dog. “Here I am, here I am. Oh,
get me out of here! I’m afraid! I’m afraid!
Mamma! Mamma! Mamma!” The little
raccoon was choking with tears!</p>

<p class='c007'>The mother and the two brother raccoons
were as happy as could be to find him! They
rubbed their noses against him through the
wires in the cage, and tried to stroke him
with their paws. Then they set to work to
get him out, if they could. First they
examined the wiring of the cage, and one after
another they worked at it with their teeth.
But the wire was thick and tough, and they
could do nothing with it. Then an idea came
to the mother raccoon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“People cut wires with files! Where can
we get a file? A file is a long piece of iron with
three sides, like the rattle of a rattlesnake.
You push it away from you across the wire,
and then you draw it toward you. Finally
the wire breaks. Let’s hunt around in the
blacksmith shop, and we may find one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They hurried off to the shop where the
farmer kept his tools. Soon they found the
file and came back with it to the cage. Thinking
it must be very hard to file off a wire, they
all took hold of the file and started pushing
it back and forth between two of the wires.
They pushed so hard that the cage began to
shake all over and made a terrible noise. In
fact, it made such a loud noise that Tuké woke
up and set to barking at the top of his voice.
The raccoons were frightened out of their wits;
and for fear the dog might ask them where
they got that file, they scampered off, with
their tails in the air, toward the forest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little boy and the little girl woke up
very early in the morning to go to see their
new pet, who had been brooding sadly in his
cage all night long.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What shall we call him?” asked the little
boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Seventeen,” answered the little girl. “I
can count to seventeen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And what did “Seventeen” have for breakfast?
One of those hen’s eggs he had tried so
hard to get the night before. And after the
hen’s egg, a grasshopper, and then a piece of
meat, and then a bunch of grapes and finally
a lump of chocolate! By the end of the day, he
was letting the two children reach their finger
through the cage to scratch his head; and so
pleased was he at all that was now happening
to him that he liked being a prisoner in a cage
almost as much as being a free raccoon cub on
the mountain side. He was all taken up with
the nice things that were placed in his coop
for him to eat; and he liked those two yellow-headed
children who kept coming to look at
him!</p>

<p class='c007'>That night and the following one, Tuké,
the dog, slept so close to “Seventeen’s” cage
that when his mother and his two brothers
came back to make another try at rescuing
him, they did not dare approach. But on the
third night everything was as it should be.
They went directly to the shop, got the file,
and hurried to the cage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But mamma,” said the little raccoon,
“I guess I’d rather stay where I am. They
feed me all the eggs I want, and they are very
kind to me. Today they told me that if I
was good, they would soon let me go about
the yard loose. There are two of them, with
yellow hair. And they are man cubs, just as
we are ’coon cubs. We shall have a fine time
playing together.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The three wild raccoons were very sad to
hear all this; but they made the best of it,
and went away, just promising to come back
and see “Seventeen” every night.</p>

<p class='c007'>And so they did. Each evening, as soon
as it was dark and whether it was fair or
rainy, the mother raccoon came with her two
cublets to see their little brother. He gave
them bread and chocolate, which he handed
out between the wires of his cage; and they ate
it on the ground nearby.</p>

<p class='c007'>In two weeks, he was let loose to run about
the yard; and every night he went back to his
cage of his own accord to sleep. He had his
ears tweeked a number of times, when the
farmer caught him too close to the hen coop;
otherwise he had no trouble at all. The two
children became much attached to him; and
when the wild raccoons heard how kind those
man cubs were to their little brother, they
began to be as fond of them as he was.</p>

<p class='c007'>But one night, when it was very dark and
very hot and a thunderstorm was gathering
on the mountains, the wild raccoons called
to “Seventeen” in vain. “Seventeen!
Seventeen! Seventeen!” But he did not answer.
In great alarm they crept up to the cage and
looked in.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pstt!</p>

<p class='c007'>They drew back just in time. There in the
door of the cage a big rattlesnake lay coiled.
They had almost touched him with their
noses. And now they knew why “Seventeen”
failed to answer! The rattlesnake had bitten
him and probably he was already dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>The three raccoons decided they must first
punish the rattlesnake. They rushed upon
him from three directions and snipped his
head off before he knew what they were about.
Then they hurried inside the cage. “Seventeen”
was lying there on the floor in a pool of
blood, his feet up in the air, and his sides
shaking as he panted for breath. They
caressed him with their tongues and licked
his body all over for more than a quarter of an
hour. But it did no good. “Seventeen”
finally opened his mouth and stopped breathing
altogether. He was dead. Raccoons
ordinarily are not much harmed by rattlesnake
poison. Some other animals are not
hurt at all. But this snake had bitten
“Seventeen” right through an artery; and
he had died, not of the poison, but from
loss of blood.</p>

<p class='c007'>The mother raccoon and her two cublets
wept over his body for a long time; then, since
they could do nothing further for him, they
left the cage where he had been so happy and
went back to the woods. But they kept
thinking all the time: “What will the two
man cubs say when they find that their little
playmate is dead? They will probably be
very, very sad and cry a long time!” They
had grown to love the man cubs just from
what “Seventeen” had said of them; and one
thought was in their three heads&mdash;to relieve
the sorrow of the two man cubs as best they
could.</p>

<p class='c007'>They talked the matter over earnestly; and
at last they agreed to the following plan.
The second youngest cublet looked almost
like the raccoon who was dead. He had the
same markings, was about the same size, and
carried himself in much the same way. Why
shouldn’t he go and crawl into the cage,
taking the place of his brother? The man
cubs would probably be surprised; but
nothing more. The four of them had talked
about everything that went on at the farm
so much, that the new raccoon could easily
pretend he had been there all along. He
might do it so well even, that the man cubs
would not notice anything at all.</p>

<p class='c007'>So they ran back to the cage, and the little
raccoon took the place of his dead brother.
The mother raccoon and her remaining cub
took hold of “Seventeen” with their teeth and
dragged him away off to the woods, where
they buried him under the leaves.</p>

<p class='c007'>The next day, the man cubs were surprised
at a number of strange habits “Seventeen”
seemed to have learned during the night.
But the new cub was just as affectionate to
them as the real “Seventeen” had been; and
they never guessed what had happened. The
two man cubs played about with the raccoon
cub all day long as usual; and at night the
two wild raccoons came to pay their usual
visit. The tame raccoon saved bits of his
boiled eggs for them each time; and they
would sit down and eat them on the ground in
front of the cage. He told them all that
happened at the farm; and they told him all
the news about doings in the woods.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='st3' class='c011'>THE PARROT THAT LOST ITS TAIL</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In the woods near a farm lived a flock of
parrots. Every morning, the parrots went
and ate sweet corn in the garden of the farm.
Afternoons they spent in the orange orchards
eating oranges. They always made a great
to-do with their screaming and jawing; but
they kept a sentinel posted on one of the tree
tops to let them know if the farmer was
coming.</p>

<p class='c007'>Parrots are very much disliked by farmers
in countries where parrots grow wild. They
bite into an ear of corn and the rest of the ear
rots when the next rain comes. Besides,
parrots are very good to eat when they are
nicely broiled. At least the farmers of South
America think so. That is why people hunt
them a great deal with shotguns.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day the hired man on this farm managed
to shoot the sentinel of the flock of
parrots. The parrot fell from the tree top
with a broken wing. But he made a good
fight of it on the ground, biting and scratching
the man several times before he was made
a prisoner. You see, the man noticed that
the bird was not very badly injured; and he
thought he would take it home as a present for
the farmer’s children.</p>

<p class='c007'>The farmer’s wife put the broken wing in
splints and tied a bandage tight around the
parrot’s body. The bird sat quite still for
many days, until he was entirely cured. Meanwhile
he had become quite tame. The children
called him Pedrito; and Pedrito learned to
hold out his claw to shake hands; he liked to
perch on people’s shoulders, and to tweek
their ears gently with his bill.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pedrito did not have to be kept in a cage.
He spent the whole day out in the orange and
eucalyptus trees in the yard of the farmhouse.
He had a great time making sport of the
hens when they cackled. The people of the
family had tea in the afternoon, and then
Pedrito would always come into the dining
room and climb up with his claws and beak
over the tablecloth to get his bread-and-milk.
What Pedrito liked best of all was bread
dipped in tea and milk.</p>

<p class='c007'>The children talked to Pedrito so much, and
he had so much to say to them, that finally he
could pronounce quite a number of words in
the language of people. He could say: “Good
day, Pedrito!” and “nice papa, nice papa”;
“papa for Pedrito!” “Papa” is the word for
bread-and-milk in South America. And he
said many things that he should not have;
for parrots, like children, learn naughty words
very easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>On rainy days Pedrito would sit on a chair
back and grumble and grumble for hours at a
time. When the sun came out again he
would begin to fly about screaming at the top
of his voice with pleasure.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pedrito, in short, was a very happy and a
very fortunate creature. He was as free as a
bird can be. At the same time he had his
afternoon tea like rich people.</p>

<p class='c007'>Now it happened that one week it rained
every day and Pedrito sat indoors glum and
disconsolate all the time, and saying the
most bitter and unhappy things to himself.
But at last one morning the sun came out
bright and glorious. Pedrito could not contain
himself: “Nice day, nice day, Pedrito!”
“Nice papa, nice papa,” “Papa for Pedrito!”
“Your paw, Pedrito!” So he went flitting
about the yard, talking gayly to himself, to
the hens, to everyone, including the beautiful,
splendid sun itself. From a tree top he saw
the river in the distance, a silvery, shining
thread winding across the plain. And he
flew off in that direction, flying, flying, flying,
till he was quite tired and had to stop on a
tree to rest.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly, on the ground far under him,
Pedrito saw something shining through the
trees, two bright green lights, as big as overgrown
lightning bugs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonder what that is?” thought Pedrito
to himself. “Nice papa! Papa for Pedrito.
Wonder what that is? Good day, Pedrito!
Your paw, Pedrito!...” And he chattered
on, just talking nonsense, and mixing his
words up so that you could scarcely have
understood him. Meantime he was jumping
down from branch to branch to get as close as
possible to the two bright gleaming lights.
At last he saw that they were the eyes of a
jaguar, who was crouching low on the ground
and staring up at him intently.</p>

<p class='c007'>But who could be afraid of anything on a
nice day like that? Not Pedrito, at any rate.
“Good day, jaguar!” said he. “Nice papa!
Papa for Pedrito! Your paw, Pedrito!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jaguar tried to make his voice as gentle
as he could; but it was with a growl that he
answered: “GOOD DAY, POLL-PARROT!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good day, good day, jaguar! Papa, papa,
papa for Pedrito! Nice papa!”</p>

<p class='c007'>You see, it was getting on toward four
o’clock in the afternoon; and all this talk
about “papa” was intended to remind the
jaguar that it was tea-time. Pedrito had
forgotten that jaguars don’t serve tea, nor
bread-and-milk, as a rule.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nice tea, nice papa! Papa for Pedrito!
Won’t you have tea with me today, jaguar?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jaguar began to get angry; for he
thought all this chatter was intended to make
fun of him. Besides, he was very hungry,
and had made up his mind to eat this garrulous
bird.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nice bird! Nice bird!” he growled.
“Please come a little closer! I’m deaf and
can’t understand what you say.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jaguar was not deaf. All he wanted
was to get the parrot to come down one more
branch, where he could reach him with his
paws. But Pedrito was thinking how pleased
the children in the family would be to see such
a sleek jaguar coming in for tea. He hopped
down one more branch and began again:
“Nice papa! Papa for Pedrito! Come home
with me, jaguar!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just a little closer!” said the jaguar. “I
can’t hear!”</p>

<div id='il2' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic003'>
<img src='images/illus-002.jpg' alt='' class='ig003' />
<p>“Nice Bird! Nice Bird!” he growled, “Please come a little closer.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>And Pedrito edged a little nearer: “Nice
papa!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Closer still!” growled the jaguar.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the parrot went down still another
branch. But just then the jaguar leaped high
in the air&mdash;oh, twice, three times his own
length, as high as a house perhaps, and
barely managed to reach Pedrito with the
tips of his claws. He did not succeed in
catching the bird but he did tear out every
single feather in Pedrito’s tail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There!” said the jaguar, “go and get
your bread-and-milk! Nice papa! Nice papa!
Lucky for you I didn’t get my paws on
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Terrified and smarting from pain, the parrot
took to his wings. He could not fly very
well, however; for birds without a tail are
much like ships without their rudders: they
cannot keep to one direction. He made the
most alarming zigzags this way and that,
to the right and to the left, and up and down.
All the birds who met him thought surely he
had gone crazy; and took good care to keep
out of his way.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, he got home again at last, and
the people were having tea in the dining
room. But the first thing that Pedrito
did was to go and look at himself in the
mirror. Poor, poor Pedrito! He was the
ugliest, most ridiculous bird on earth! Not
a feather to his tail! His coat of down all
ruffled and bleeding! Shivering with chills
of fright all over! How could any self-respecting
bird appear in society in such
disarray?</p>

<p class='c007'>Though he would have given almost anything
in the world for his usual bread-and-milk
that day, he flew off to a hollow eucalyptus
tree he knew about, crawled in through
a hole, and nestled down in the dark, still
shivering with cold and drooping his head
and wings in shame.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the dining room, meantime, everybody
was wondering where the parrot was. “Pedrito!
Pedrito!” the children came calling to
the door. “Pedrito! Papa, Pedrito. Nice
papa! Papa for Pedrito!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Pedrito did not say a word. Pedrito
did not stir. He just sat there in his hole,
sullen, gloomy, and disconsolate. The children
looked for him everywhere, but he did
not appear. Everybody thought he had gotten
lost, perhaps, or that some cat had eaten
him; and the little ones began to cry.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the days went by. And every day, at
tea-time, the farmer’s family remembered
Pedrito and how he used to come and have
tea with them. Poor Pedrito! Pedrito was
dead! No one would ever see Pedrito again!</p>

<p class='c007'>But Pedrito was not dead at all. He was
just a proud bird; and would have been
ashamed to let anybody see him without his
tail. He waited in his hole till everybody
went to bed; then he would come out, get
something to eat, and return to his hiding
place again. Each morning, just after daylight,
and before anybody was up, he would
go into the kitchen and look at himself in the
mirror, getting more and more bad-tempered
meanwhile because his feathers grew so slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Until one afternoon, when the family had
gathered in the dining room for tea as usual,
who should come into the room but Pedrito!
He walked in just as though nothing at all
had happened, perched for a moment on a
chair back, and then climbed up the tablecloth
to get his bread-and-milk. The people
just laughed and wept for joy, and clapped
their hands especially to see what pretty
feathers the bird had. “Pedrito! Why Pedrito!
Where in the world have you been?
What happened to you? And what pretty,
pretty feathers!”</p>

<p class='c007'>You see, they did not know that they were
new feathers; and Pedrito, for his part, said
not a word. He was not going to tell them
anything about it. He just ate one piece
of bread-and-milk after another. “Papa,
Pedrito! Nice papa! Papa for Pedrito!” Of
course, he said a few things like that. But
otherwise, not a word.</p>

<p class='c007'>That was why the farmer was very much
surprised the next day when Pedrito flew
down out of a tree top and alighted on his
shoulder, chattering and chattering as though
he had something very exciting on his mind.
In two minutes, Pedrito told him all about
it&mdash;how, in his joy at the nice weather, he
had flown down to the Parana; how he
had invited the jaguar to tea; and how the
jaguar had deceived him and left his tail
without a feather. “Without a feather, a
single blessed feather!” the parrot repeated,
in rage at such an indignity. And he ended
by asking the farmer to go and shoot that
jaguar.</p>

<p class='c007'>It happened that they needed a new mat
for the fireplace in the dining room, and the
farmer was very glad to hear there was a
jaguar in the neighborhood. He went into
the house to get his gun, and then set out with
Pedrito toward the river. They agreed that
when Pedrito saw the jaguar he would begin
to scream to attract the beast’s attention.
In that way the man could come up close and
get a good shot with his gun.</p>

<p class='c007'>And that is just what happened. Pedrito
flew up to a tree top and began to talk as
noisily as he could, meanwhile looking in all
directions to see if the jaguar were about.
Soon he heard some branches crackling under
the tree on the ground; and peering down he
saw the two green lights fixed upon him.
“Nice day!” he began. “Nice papa! Papa
for Pedrito! Your paw, Pedrito!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jaguar was very cross to see that this
same parrot had come around again and
with prettier feathers than before. “You
will not get away this time!” he growled to
himself, glaring up at Pedrito more fiercely
than before.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Closer! Closer! I’m deaf! I can’t hear
what you say!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And Pedrito, as he had done the other time,
came down first one branch and then another,
talking all the time at the top of his voice:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa for Pedrito! Nice papa! At the
foot of this tree! Your paw, Pedrito! At
the foot of this tree!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The jaguar grew suspicious at these new
words, and, rising part way on his hind legs,
he growled:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is that you are talking to? Why do
you say I am at the foot of this tree!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good day, Pedrito! Papa, papa for Pedrito!”
answered the parrot; and he came
down one more branch, and still another.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Closer, closer!” growled the jaguar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pedrito could see that the farmer was stealing
up very stealthily with his gun. And he
was glad of that, for one more branch and he
would be almost in the jaguar’s claws.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Papa, papa for Pedrito! Nice papa! Are
you almost ready?” he called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Closer, closer,” growled the jaguar, getting
ready to spring.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your paw, Pedrito! He’s ready to jump!
Papa, Pedrito!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the jaguar, in fact, leaped into the air.
But this time Pedrito was ready for him. He
took lightly to his wings and flew up to the
tree top far out of reach of the terrible claws.
The farmer, meanwhile, had been taking careful
aim; and just as the jaguar reached the
ground, there was a loud report. Nine balls
of lead as large as peas entered the heart of
the jaguar, who gave one great roar and fell
over dead.</p>

<p class='c007'>Pedrito was chattering about in great glee;
because now he could fly around in the forest
without fear of being eaten; and his tail
feathers would never be torn out again. The
farmer, too, was happy; because a jaguar
is very hard to find anyway; and the skin of
this one made a very beautiful rug indeed.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they got back home again, everybody
learned why Pedrito had been away so long,
and how he had hidden in the hollow tree to
grow his feathers back again. And the children
were very proud that their pet had
trapped the jaguar so cleverly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thereafter there was a happy life in the
farmer’s home for a long, long time. But
the parrot never forgot what the jaguar had
tried to do to him. In the afternoon when tea
was being served in the dining room, he would
go over to the skin lying in front of the fireplace
and invite the jaguar to have bread-and-milk
with him: “Papa, nice papa! Papa
for Pedrito! Papa for jaguar? Nice papa!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And when everybody laughed, Pedrito
would laugh too.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='st4' class='c011'>THE BLIND DOE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Once upon a time there was a deer&mdash;a doe&mdash;who
gave birth to two little deers; and, as is
very rare with such animals, the little deers
were twins. However, a wildcat ate one of
them; and the second, a female, had to live
her childhood without a playmate.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was such a beautiful little creature,
nevertheless, that all the mother deers in the
forest wished she belonged to them; and to
show their affection they were always nipping
gently at her ribs with their lips.</p>

<p class='c007'>Every morning when the little deer got up
out of bed, her mother would make her say
the catechism which all deers learn when they
are babies:</p>

<p class='c007'>I. I must smell of each green leaf before I
eat it; because some green leaves are
poisonous.</p>

<p class='c007'>II. I must stop and look carefully up and
down the brook before I lower my head to
drink; for otherwise an alligator may eat
me.</p>

<p class='c007'>III. I must lift my head every half hour and
sniff carefully in all directions; otherwise a
panther may steal up and catch me.</p>

<p class='c007'>IV. I must look ahead of me when I am
grazing in a meadow; otherwise a snake may
bite me.</p>

<p class='c007'>All good fawns learn this catechism by
heart; and when this little deer could say it
all by herself, her mother began to let her go
away from home alone.</p>

<p class='c007'>One afternoon in summer, when the fawn
was wandering over the mountain side looking
for the tenderest tufts of grass, she saw a
tree with a hollow trunk in front of her. Inside
it a number of small slate-colored bags were
hanging.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What in the world is that?” said the little
deer to herself. She had never seen anything
of just that kind! Now deers, like people,
are inclined to be a bit disrespectful towards
things they don’t understand. Those puffy
slate-colored bags seemed to her about the
most ridiculous things there was on earth!
So she butted them with all her might.</p>

<p class='c007'>She now saw that she had made a great
dent in the bags, which began to drip with
drops of shining fluid. At the same time a
swarm of reddish flies, with narrow waists,
came out, buzzing around and walking about,
over their broken nest.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little deer edged nearer. Curiously,
those red flies did not seem to mind at all! And
what about that juicy-looking stuff? Carefully,
gently, the fawn stretched out her head
till she was able to touch one of the drops
of fluid with the tip of her tongue.</p>

<p class='c007'>What a surprise, what a wonderful surprise,
for such a little, and such an inexperienced
deer! She smacked her lips and licked her
nose with her tongue, hurrying to lap up
all the drops she could find. For they
were honey, honey of the sweetest kind.
And the red flies were bees! They did not
sting because they had no stingers! There
are bees like that, you know, in South
America.</p>

<p class='c007'>Not content with the few drops that were
slowly oozing out of the cracks in the bags,
the little deer now broke all the nests down
and ate every bit of the honey in them; then,
leaping and jumping with pride and delight,
she hurried home to tell her mother all about
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the mother deer frowned severely:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out for bees’ nests, my child!” she
exclaimed earnestly. “Honey is very good
to eat; but it is dangerous to get at it. Keep
away from all the nests you see!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But bees don’t sting, mamma!” the little
deer objected gleefully. “Hornets sting, and
wasps sting; but bees, no!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That isn’t so, my dear!” the mother
answered. “You had good luck, that’s all.
Bees are quite as bad as wasps. Now mind
me, child, or some day you’ll be sorry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, mamma, I’ll be careful,” said the
little deer.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the first thing she did the very next
morning was to take one of the paths that
people had made over the mountains. She
had figured out that, running along in the
open, she could cover more ground and see
the bees’ nests better!</p>

<p class='c007'>And at last the search of the little deer was
successful. She came upon a nest of bees&mdash;as
she thought&mdash;black ones this time, with
yellow sashes about their belts; and many of
them were walking over the outside of the
nest. The nest, also, was of a different color,
and much larger than the bags the little deer
had found the day before. But such things
made no difference to her. “If the nest is
larger,” she concluded simply, “the honey
is probably sweeter and there’s more of
it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But then she suddenly remembered all that
her mother had said. “Oh, mother is too
afraid! All mothers are too afraid!” And
she finished by giving a lusty butt at the
nest.</p>

<p class='c007'>In a second or two she had bitterly repented
of her folly. The “bees” were ordinary bees
and there were thousands of them. They
rushed forth from the nest in a great swarm,
settled all over the head, neck, and shoulders
of the little deer, and even under her belly
and on her tail. And they stung her all over,
but worst of all about the eyes. There were
more than ten stings to each eye!</p>

<p class='c007'>The little deer, wild with pain and fright,
began to run screaming away. She ran and
ran. But finally she had to stop, because
she could no longer see where she was going.
Her eyes were all swollen; so swollen she
could not open them. Trembling with
fear and smarting with pain, she stopped
where she was and began to cry piteously:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mamma!... Mamma!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The mother deer was much worried when
the afternoon wore on and her child did not
come home; and at last she started out to
look for her, following by smell, as deers can,
the tracks of her little one over the hillsides.
What was her despair when, finally, she heard
the disobedient fawn weeping in the distance;
and how much blacker her despair became
when she found that the child was blind!</p>

<p class='c007'>Slowly the two deers started home again,
the fawn’s nose resting on her mother’s hip.
And along the road all the old bucks and does
came up to examine the little one’s eyes and
give their opinions as to a cure. The mother
deer did not know what to do. She had no
plasters nor poultices to soothe the pain in
her child’s eyes. She learned ultimately that
across the mountains lived a man who was
skillful with remedies. This man was a
hunter, and traded in venison. But, from
all reports, she concluded that he was quite a
kind-hearted person.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though the doe shivered at the thought of
visiting a man who made his living on the
slaughter of deer, she was willing to risk anything
for her offspring. However, she had
never met the man personally, and she thought
it best to ask for a letter of introduction from
the Anteater, who was supposed to be on
very good terms with all the human kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was night; and the panthers and wildcats
were rampant through all the forest; but
the mother deer did not wait an instant.
She covered her little one carefully with
branches so that no one could find her, and
then made off toward the Anteater’s house.
She went so fast and so far that she was faint
with fatigue when she arrived there; and
once, on the road, she escaped only by
merest chance from the fangs of a mountain
lion.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Anteater was one of the smaller members
of his tribe&mdash;a yellow little fellow with a
black cape thrown over his shoulders and
reaching down to the waist, where it was tied
under his belly with black strings.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just how or why the Anteater became so
friendly with the hunter, no one in the forest
knew; but some day the truth will be known,
doubtless.</p>

<p class='c007'>At any rate, the poor doe arrived at the
house where the Anteater lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tan! Tan! Tan!” she knocked, panting.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s that?” answered the Anteater
sleepily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s me!” said the doe; though she corrected
herself almost immediately, and
said:	“It is I&mdash;a deer, the mother of the
twins!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see,” said the Anteater. “So it’s
you! Well, what do you want?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want you to introduce me to the hunter.
The fawn, my daughter, is blind!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t say so? That little fawn that
everybody makes so much of? She’s a dear
little thing! I don’t have to be asked twice
to do a favor when that child is concerned!
I’ll introduce you gladly. But you won’t
need a letter. Just show the man this, and
he’ll do all you ask.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Anteater rummaged around in the
leaves for a while and at last stretched his
tail out. On the tip of it was the head of a
snake, completely dried, and with the poison
fangs still in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks ever so much,” exclaimed the
doe. “But that man is a venison hunter!
Do you think this is all I need?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Quite!” the Anteater averred.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are a very kind-hearted Anteater,”
the doe replied, her eyes filling with tears. But
she did not prolong the conversation. It
was getting to be very late, and she had to be
at the hunter’s lodge by daybreak.</p>

<p class='c007'>She hurried back to her house and got the
fawn, who still lay there weeping in her bed.
Together they made their way toward the
village where the hunter lived. They stole
along very softly, keeping close to the walls of
the houses, so that the dogs would not see nor
hear them.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the door of the hunter’s cottage the
mother knocked loudly:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tan! Tan! Tan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the little deer knocked as loudly as she
could.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ta! Ta! Ta!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s there?” a voice called from within.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s us,” said the fawn.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s we,” corrected the mother. “We
are friends of the Anteater, and we have the
snake’s head!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see,” said the hunter opening the door.
“What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My daughter, this little fawn here, is
blind. Can you help her?”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the mother deer told the whole story
about her child and the bees.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hum!” said the man. “Just let me see
what ails this nice young lady!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Reentering the cottage, the hunter soon
came back with a rather high stool, on which
he set the fawn in such a manner that he
could examine her eyes without bending over.
Then he took out a big lens and began to
look at the stings, while the mother deer
stood by, holding a lantern around her neck
so that the “doctor” could see better. For
the sun had not yet risen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, there’s nothing to worry about,” the
hunter said to the fond parent, helping her
little one out of the chair. “It’s only a
matter of time and care. Wrap her head up,
and keep a bandage with this ointment across
her eyes. Then keep her in the dark for
twenty days. After that, have her wear these
yellow glasses for a week or two; and by that
time she will be all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks, many, many thanks,” said the
mother deer warmly and gratefully. “And
now, sir, how much do I owe you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nothing at all, nothing at all, madam,”
the hunter replied with a smile. “But one
thing more: look out for the dogs in the
next house. A man lives there who keeps
hounds especially for chasing deer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this news the mother deer and her child
were so scared they hardly dared breathe;
and as they went away they walked on tiptoe,
and stopped every few feet. Even at that the
dogs heard them and gave chase for nearly a
mile into the forest. But the mother deer
found a narrow path, opening into the bush
where the blind fawn could run quite safely;
and they made good their escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little deer got well, just as the hunter
had said she would; though the care and
trouble it cost the mother to keep her fawn
shut up for twenty long days inside a hollow
tree, she only knew. Inside there you could
not have seen your hand before your face!
But at last, one morning, the mother deer
brushed aside the branches she had woven
across the hole in the tree so tightly as to
keep out all light; and the fawn, now with the
yellow glasses on her nose, came out into the
broad day.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I can see now, mamma, I can see all
right!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the mother deer, to tell the truth, had
to go and hide her head in a clump of bushes
to conceal the tears of joy that came to
her eyes when she saw her little one cured
at last. In two weeks, the glasses were laid
aside.</p>

<p class='c007'>As time wore on, the fawn, though happy
to be quite herself again, began to grow sad.
She was anxious to repay the hunter for his
kindness to her; and she could think of no
possible way of doing it.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day, however, an idea occurred to her.
As she was trotting along the shore of a pond
she came upon a feather which a blue heron
had let fall there. “I wonder if that good
man would like it?” she thought. And she
picked it up.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, one night when it was raining hard
and the dogs would probably be under cover,
she started out for the hunter’s cottage.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man was reading in his bedroom,
feeling quite cozy besides, for he had just
completed a thatched roof for his cabin when
the rain began. Now he was quite safe and
dry out of reach of the storm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tan! Tan! Tan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>When he opened the door, the little deer,
whom he had treated and of whom he had
often thought since then, was standing there
in the rain, with the heron’s plume, all wet
and drooping, in her mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here is something I have brought for
you,” the fawn explained.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the hunter began to laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little deer went off home in great shame
and sorrow. She thought the man had
laughed in ridicule of her poor gift! So
thereafter she went looking for a better, bigger
feather to give her benefactor; and this time
she found some plumes that were truly
splendid ones; and she was careful to keep
them clean and dry.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again she went back, one night, to the
hunter’s cabin; and this time he did not
laugh. He was a courteous, polite man;
and he understood that, the other time, he
had hurt his little friend’s feelings by laughing
at her. Instead, he now invited her indoors,
drew the high chair up to the table and gave
her a saucerful of honey. Gobble, gobble!
The little deer lapped the sweet up in mad
delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>From that time on, the two became great
friends. The fawn spent a great deal of her
time collecting heron plumes, which the man
sold for a large sum of money. And every
time she came in with a feather, the hunter
gave her a jar of honey; and occasionally he
offered her a cigar, which the little deer ate,
but, of course, did not smoke. Smoking is
bad even for deers.</p>

<p class='c007'>Whole nights the two friends thus spent
together, talking in front of the open fire,
while the wind was howling outside; for the
deer made her visits only in stormy weather
when dogs would be sure not to be about. In
a short time whenever the skies were dark and
gave promise of a bad night, the hunter began
to expect these visits. He would light a
lamp, set a jar of honey on the table, take out
a book and begin to read, waiting for the
“Tan! Tan! Tan!” of the little deer, who
remained his loyal friend all her life.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='st5' class='c011'>THE ALLIGATOR WAR</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It was a very big river in a region of South
America that had never been visited by white
men; and in it lived many, many alligators&mdash;perhaps
a hundred, perhaps a thousand.
For dinner they ate fish, which they caught in
the stream, and for supper they ate deer and
other animals that came down to the water
side to drink. On hot afternoons in summer
they stretched out and sunned themselves on
the bank. But they liked nights when the
moon was shining best of all. Then they
swam out into the river and sported and
played, lashing the water to foam with their
tails, while the spray ran off their beautiful
skins in all the colors of the rainbow.</p>

<p class='c007'>These alligators had lived quite happy
lives for a long, long time. But at last one
afternoon, when they were all sleeping on the
sand, snoring and snoring, one alligator woke
up and cocked his ears&mdash;the way alligators
cock their ears. He listened and listened,
and, to be sure, faintly, and from a great
distance, came a sound: <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i></p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey!” the alligator called to the alligator
sleeping next to him, “Hey! Wake up!
Danger!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Danger of what?” asked the other, opening
his eyes sleepily, and getting up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know!” replied the first alligator.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s a noise I never heard before. Listen!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The other alligator listened: <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i>
<i>Chug!</i></p>

<p class='c007'>In great alarm the two alligators went calling
up and down the river bank: “Danger!
Danger!” And all their sisters and brothers
and mothers and fathers and uncles and
aunts woke up and began running this way
and that with their tails curled up in the air.
But the excitement did not serve to calm their
fears. <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i> The noise was
growing louder every moment; and at last,
away off down the stream, they could see
something moving along the surface of the
river, leaving a trail of gray smoke behind it
and beating the water on either side to foam:
<i>Chush!</i> <i>Chush!</i> <i>Chush!</i></p>

<p class='c007'>The alligators looked at each other in the
greatest astonishment: “What on earth is
that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was one old alligator, the wisest
and most experienced of them all. He was so
old that only two sound teeth were left in his
jaws&mdash;one in the upper jaw and one in the
lower jaw. Once, also, when he was a boy,
fond of adventure, he had made a trip down
the river all the way to the sea.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know what it is,” said he. “It’s a
whale. Whales are big fish, they shoot water
up through their noses, and it falls down on
them behind.”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this news, the little alligators began to
scream at the top of their lungs, “It’s a whale!
It’s a whale! It’s a whale!” and they made for
the water intending to duck out of sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the big alligator cuffed with his tail
a little alligator that was screaming nearby
with his mouth open wide. “Dry up!” said
he. “There’s nothing to be afraid of! I
know all about whales! Whales are the
afraidest people there are!” And the little
alligators stopped their noise.</p>

<p class='c007'>But they grew frightened again a moment
afterwards. The gray smoke suddenly turned
to an inky black, and the <i>Chush!</i> <i>Chush!</i>
<i>Chush!</i> was now so loud that all the alligators
took to the water, with only their eyes and the
tips of their noses showing at the surface.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Cho-ash-h-h!</i> <i>Cho-ash-h-h!</i> <i>Cho-ash-h-h!</i>
The strange monster came rapidly up the
stream. The alligators saw it go crashing
past them, belching great clouds of smoke
from the middle of its back, and splashing
into the water heavily with the big revolving
things it had on either side.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was a steamer, the first steamer that had
ever made its way up the Parana. <i>Chush!</i>
<i>Chush!</i> <i>Chush!</i> It seemed to be getting
further away again. <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i>
It had disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='c007'>One by one, the alligators climbed up out
of the water onto the bank again. They were
all quite cross with the old alligator who had
told them wrongly that it was a whale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was not a whale!” they shouted in his
ear&mdash;for he was rather hard of hearing. “Well,
what was it that just went by?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old alligator then explained that it was
a steamboat full of fire; and that the alligators
would all die if the boat continued to
go up and down the river.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other alligators only laughed, however.
Why would the alligators die if the
boat kept going up and down the river? It
had passed by without so much as speaking
to them! That old alligator didn’t really
know so much as he pretended to! And since
they were very hungry they all went fishing in
the stream. But alas! There was not a fish
to be found! The steamboat had frightened
every single one of them away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what did I tell you?” said the old
alligator. “You see: we haven’t anything
left to eat! All the fish have been frightened
away! However&mdash;let’s just wait till tomorrow.
Perhaps the boat won’t come back
again. In that case, the fish will get over
their fright and come back so that we can eat
them.” But the next day, the steamboat
came crashing by again on its way back
down the river, spouting black smoke as it
had done before, and setting the whole river
boiling with its paddle wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well!” exclaimed the alligators. “What
do you think of that? The boat came yesterday.
The boat came today. The boat will
come tomorrow. The fish will stay away;
and nothing will come down here at night to
drink. We are done for!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But an idea occurred to one of the brighter
alligators: “Let’s dam the river!” he proposed.
“The steamboat won’t be able to
climb a dam!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the talk! That’s the talk! A dam!
A dam! Let’s build a dam!” And the alligators
all made for the shore as fast as they could.</p>

<p class='c007'>They went up into the woods along the
bank and began to cut down trees of the
hardest wood they could find&mdash;walnut and
mahogany, mostly. They felled more than
ten thousand of them altogether, sawing the
trunks through with the kind of saw that
alligators have on the tops of their tails.
They dragged the trees down into the water
and stood them up about a yard apart, all
the way across the river, driving the pointed
ends deep into the mud and weaving the
branches together. No steamboat, big or
little, would ever be able to pass that dam!
No one would frighten the fish away again!
They would have a good dinner the following
day and every day! And since it was late at
night by the time the dam was done, they
all fell sound asleep on the river bank.</p>

<p class='c007'><i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chug!</i> <i>Chush!</i> <i>Chush!</i> <i>Chush!</i>
<i>Cho-ash-h-h-h!</i> <i>Cho-ash-h-h-h!</i> <i>Cho-ash-h-h-h!</i></p>

<p class='c007'>They were still asleep, the next day, when
the boat came up; but the alligators barely
opened their eyes and then tried to go to
sleep again. What did they care about the
boat? It could make all the noise it wanted,
but it would never get by the dam!</p>

<p class='c007'>And that is what happened. Soon the
noise from the boat stopped. The men who
were steering on the bridge took out their
spy-glasses and began to study the strange
obstruction that had been thrown up across
the river. Finally a small boat was sent to
look into it more closely. Only then did the
alligators get up from where they were sleeping,
run down into the water, and swim out
behind the dam, where they lay floating and
looking downstream between the piles. They
could not help laughing, nevertheless, at the
joke they had played on the steamboat!</p>

<p class='c007'>The small boat came up, and the men in it
saw how the alligators had made a dam across
the river. They went back to the steamer,
but soon after, came rowing up toward the
dam again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, you, alligators!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can we do for you?” answered the
alligators, sticking their heads through between
the piles in the dam.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That dam is in our way!” said the
men.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell us something we don’t know!” answered
the alligators.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we can’t get by!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll say so!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, take the old thing out of the way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Nosireesir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The men in the boat talked it over for a
while and then they called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alligators!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What can we do for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you take the dam away?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well! See you later!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The later the better,” said the alligators.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rowboat went back to the steamer,
while the alligators, as happy as could be,
clapped their tails as loud as they could on
the water. No boat could ever get by that
dam, and drive the fish away again!</p>

<p class='c007'>But the next day the steamboat returned;
and when the alligators looked at it, they
could not say a word from their surprise:
it was not the same boat at all, but a larger
one, painted gray like a mouse! How many
steamboats were there, anyway? And this
one probably would want to pass the dam!
Well, just let it try! No, sir! No steamboat,
little or big, would ever get through that dam!</p>

<p class='c007'>“They shall not pass!” said the alligators,
each taking up his station behind the piles in
the dam.</p>

<p class='c007'>The new boat, like the other one, stopped
some distance below the dam; and again a
little boat came rowing toward them. This
time there were eight sailors in it, with one
officer. The officer shouted:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, you, alligators!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter?” answered the alligators.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Going to get that dam out of there?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well!” said the officer. “In that
case, we shall have to shoot it down!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shoot it up if you want to!” said the
alligators.</p>

<p class='c007'>And the boat returned to the steamer.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now, this mouse-gray steamboat was
not an ordinary steamboat: it was a warship,
with armor plate and terribly powerful guns.
The old alligator who had made the trip to
the river mouth suddenly remembered, and
just in time to shout to the other alligators:
“Duck for your lives! Duck! She’s going
to shoot! Keep down deep under water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The alligators dived all at the same time,
and headed for the shore, where they halted,
keeping all their bodies out of sight except for
their noses and their eyes. A great cloud of
flame and smoke burst from the vessel’s side,
followed by a deafening report. An immense
solid shot hurtled through the air and struck
the dam exactly in the middle. Two or three
tree trunks were cut away into splinters and
drifted off downstream. Another shot, a
third, and finally a fourth, each tearing a
great hole in the dam. Finally the piles were
entirely destroyed; not a tree, not a splinter,
not a piece of bark, was left; and the alligators,
still sitting with their eyes and noses
just out of water, saw the warship come steaming
by and blowing its whistle in derision at
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the alligators came out on the bank
and held a council of war. “Our dam was not
strong enough,” said they; “we must make
a new and much thicker one.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So they worked again all that afternoon
and night, cutting down the very biggest trees
they could find, and making a much better
dam than they had built before. When the
gunboat appeared the next day, they were
sleeping soundly and had to hurry to get
behind the piles of the dam by the time the
rowboat arrived there.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, alligators!” called the same officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“See who’s here again!” said the alligators,
jeeringly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get that new dam out of there!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never in the world!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we’ll blow it up, the way we did the
other!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blaze away, and good luck to you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>You see, the alligators talked so big because
they were sure the dam they had made this
time would hold up against the most terrible
cannon balls in the world. And the sailors
must have thought so, too; for after they had
fired the first shot a tremendous explosion
occurred in the dam. The gunboat was
using shells, which burst among the timbers
of the dam and broke the thickest trees into
tiny, tiny bits. A second shell exploded right
near the first, and a third near the second.
So the shots went all along the dam, each
tearing away a long strip of it till nothing,
nothing, nothing was left. Again the warship
came steaming by, closer in toward shore on
this occasion, so that the sailors could make
fun of the alligators by putting their hands to
their mouths and holloing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So that’s it!” said the alligators, climbing
up out of the water. “We must all die,
because the steamboats will keep coming and
going, up and down, and leaving us not a
fish in the world to eat!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The littlest alligators were already whimpering;
for they had had no dinner for three days;
and it was a crowd of very sad alligators that
gathered on the river shore to hear what the
old alligator now had to say.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We have only one hope left,” he began.
“We must go and see the Sturgeon! When
I was a boy, I took that trip down to the sea
along with him. He liked the salt water
better than I did, and went quite a way out
into the ocean. There he saw a sea fight between
two of these boats; and he brought
home a torpedo that had failed to explode.
Suppose we go and ask him to give it to us.
It is true the Sturgeon has never liked us
alligators; but I got along with him pretty
well myself. He is a good fellow, at bottom,
and surely he will not want to see us all
starve!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The fact was that some years before an
alligator had eaten one of the Sturgeon’s
favorite grandchildren; and for that reason
the Sturgeon had refused ever since to call on
the alligators or receive visits from them.
Nevertheless, the alligators now trouped off
in a body to the big cave under the bank of the
river where they knew the Sturgeon stayed,
with his torpedo beside him. There are
sturgeons as much as six feet long, you know,
and this one with the torpedo was of that kind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mr. Sturgeon! Mr. Sturgeon!” called
the alligators at the entrance of the cave.
No one of them dared go in, you see, on
account of that matter of the sturgeon’s
grandchild.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is it?” answered the Sturgeon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re the alligators,” the latter replied
in a chorus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have nothing to do with alligators,”
grumbled the Sturgeon crossly.</p>

<p class='c007'>But now the old alligator with the two
teeth stepped forward and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, hello, Sturgy. Don’t you remember
Ally, your old friend that took that trip down
the river, when we were boys?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, well! Where have you been keeping
yourself all these years,” said the Sturgeon,
surprised and pleased to hear his old friend’s
voice. “Sorry I didn’t know it was you!
How goes it? What can I do for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve come to ask you for that torpedo
you found, remember? You see, there’s a
warship keeps coming up and down our
river scaring all the fish away. She’s a
whopper, I’ll tell you, armor plate, guns, the
whole thing! We made one dam and she
knocked it down. We made another and she
blew it up. The fish have all gone away and
we haven’t had a bite to eat in near onto a
week. Now you give us your torpedo and
we’ll do the rest!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sturgeon sat thinking for a long time,
scratching his chin with one of his fins. At
last he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“As for the torpedo, all right! You can
have it in spite of what you did to my eldest
son’s first-born. But there’s one trouble:
who knows how to work the thing?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The alligators were all silent. Not one of
them had ever seen a torpedo.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the Sturgeon, proudly, “I
can see I’ll have to go with you myself. I’ve
lived next to that torpedo a long time. I
know all about torpedoes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The first task was to bring the torpedo
down to the dam. The alligators got into
line, the one behind taking in his mouth the
tail of the one in front. When the line was
formed it was fully a quarter of a mile long.
The Sturgeon pushed the torpedo out into
the current, and got under it so as to hold it
up near the top of the water on his back.
Then he took the tail of the last alligator in
his teeth, and gave the signal to go ahead.
The Sturgeon kept the torpedo afloat, while
the alligators towed him along. In this way
they went so fast that a wide wake followed
on after the torpedo; and by the next morning
they were back at the place where the dam
was made.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the little alligators who had stayed at
home reported, the warship had already gone
by upstream. But this pleased the others
all the more. Now they would build a new
dam, stronger than ever before, and catch
the steamer in a trap, so that it would never
get home again.</p>

<p class='c007'>They worked all that day and all the next
night, making a thick, almost solid dike,
with barely enough room between the piles
for the alligators to stick their heads through.
They had just finished when the gunboat
came into view.</p>

<p class='c007'>Again the rowboat approached with the
eight men and their officer. The alligators
crowded behind the dam in great excitement,
moving their paws to hold their own with the
current; for this time, they were downstream.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hey, alligators!” called the officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well?” answered the alligators.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still another dam?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If at first you don’t succeed, try, try,
again!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get that dam out of there!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won’t?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We won’t!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well! Now you alligators just listen!
If you won’t be reasonable, we are going to
knock this dam down, too. But to save you
the trouble of building a fourth, we are going
to shoot every blessed alligator around here.
Yes, every single last alligator, women and
children, big ones, little ones, fat ones, lean
ones, and even that old codger sitting there
with only two teeth left in his jaws!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old alligator understood that the officer
was trying to insult him with that reference
to his two teeth, and he answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young man, what you say is true. I
have only two teeth left, not counting one or
two others that are broken off. But do you
know what those two teeth are going to eat for
dinner?” As he said this the old alligator
opened his mouth wide, wide, wide.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what are they going to eat?” asked
one of the sailors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little dude of a naval officer I see in a
boat over there!”&mdash;and the old alligator dived
under water and disappeared from view.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime the Sturgeon had brought the
torpedo to the very center of the dam, where
four alligators were holding it fast to the
river bottom waiting for orders to bring it
up to the top of the water. The other alligators
had gathered along the shore, with
their noses and eyes alone in sight as usual.</p>

<p class='c007'>The rowboat went back to the ship. When
he saw the men climbing aboard, the Sturgeon
went down to his torpedo.</p>

<p class='c007'>Suddenly there was a loud detonation.
The warship had begun firing, and the first
shell struck and exploded in the middle of
the dam. A great gap opened in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now! Now!” called the Sturgeon sharply,
on seeing that there was room for the torpedo
to go through. “Let her go! Let her go!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As the torpedo came to the surface, the
Sturgeon steered it to the opening in the dam,
took aim hurriedly with one eye closed, and
pulled at the trigger of the torpedo with his
teeth. The propeller of the torpedo began to
revolve, and it started off upstream toward
the gunboat.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it was high time. At that instant a
second shot exploded in the dam, tearing
away another large section.</p>

<p class='c007'>From the wake the torpedo left behind it in
the water the men on the vessel saw the danger
they were in, but it was too late to do anything
about it. The torpedo struck the ship in the
middle, and went off.</p>

<p class='c007'>You can never guess the terrible noise that
torpedo made. It blew the warship into
fifteen thousand million pieces, tossing guns,
and smokestacks, and shells and rowboats&mdash;everything,
hundreds and hundreds of yards
away.</p>

<p class='c007'>The alligators all screamed with triumph
and made as fast as they could for the dam.
Down through the opening bits of wood came
floating, with a number of sailors swimming
as hard as they could for the shore. As the
men passed through, the alligators put their
paws to their mouths and holloed, as the
men had done to them three days before.
They decided not to eat a single one of the
sailors, though some of them deserved it
without a doubt. Except that when a man
dressed in a blue uniform with gold braid
came by, the old alligator jumped into the
water off the dam, and snap! snap! ate him in
two mouthfuls.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who was that man?” asked an ignorant
young alligator, who never learned his lessons
in school and never knew what was
going on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s the officer of the boat,” answered the
Sturgeon. “My old friend, Ally, said he
was going to eat him, and eaten him he
has!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The alligators tore down the rest of the
dam, because they knew that no boats would
be coming by that way again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The Sturgeon, who had quite fallen in love
with the gold lace of the officer, asked that it
be given him in payment for the use of his
torpedo. The alligators said he might have
it for the trouble of picking it out of the old
alligator’s mouth, where it had caught on the
two teeth. They gave him also the officer’s
belt and sword. The Sturgeon put the belt
on just behind his front fins, and buckled
the sword to it. Thus togged out, he swam
up and down for more than an hour in front of
the assembled alligators, who admired his
beautiful spotted skin as something almost
as pretty as the coral snake’s, and who opened
their mouths wide at the splendor of his
uniform. Finally they escorted him in honor
back to his cave under the river bank,
thanking him over and over again, and giving him
three cheers as they went off.</p>

<p class='c007'>When they returned to their usual place
they found the fish had already returned. The
next day another steamboat came by; but the
alligators did not care, because the fish were
getting used to it by this time and seemed
not to be afraid. Since then the boats have
been going back and forth all the time, carrying
oranges. And the alligators open their
eyes when they hear the <i>chug! chug! chug!</i> of
a steamboat and laugh at the thought of how
scared they were the first time, and of how
they sank the warship.</p>

<p class='c007'>But no warship has ever gone up the river
since the old alligator ate the officer.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='st6' class='c011'>HOW THE FLAMINGOES GOT THEIR STOCKINGS</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Once the snakes decided that they would
give a costume ball; and to make the affair
a truly brilliant one they sent invitations
to the frogs, the toads, the alligators and the
fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fish replied that since they had no
legs they would not be able to do much dancing;
whereupon, as a special courtesy to them,
the ball was held on the shore of the Parana.
The fish swam up to the very beach and sat
looking on with their heads out of water.
When anything pleased them they splashed
with their tails.</p>

<p class='c007'>To make as good an appearance as possible,
the alligators put necklaces of bananas around
their throats; and they came to the ball
smoking big Paraguay cigars. The toads
stuck fish scales all over their bodies; and
when they walked, they moved their forelegs
out and in as though they were swimming.
They strutted up and down the beach with
very glum, determined faces; and the fish kept
calling to them, making fun of their scales.
The frogs were satisfied to leave their smooth
green skins just as they were; but they bathed
themselves in perfume and walked on their
hind legs. Besides, each one carried a lightning
bug, which waved to and fro like a lantern,
at the end of a string in the frog’s hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the best costumes of all were worn by
the snakes. All of them, without exception,
had dancing gowns of the color of their skins.
There were red snakes, and brown snakes, and
pink snakes, and yellow snakes&mdash;each with a
garment of tulle to match. The <i>yarara</i>, who
is a kind of rattler, came in a single-piece
robe of gray tulle with brick-colored stripes&mdash;for
that is the way the <i>yarara</i> dresses even
when he is not going to a ball. The coral
snakes were prettier still. They draped themselves
in a gauze of reds, whites and blacks;
and when they danced, they wound
themselves round and round like corkscrews, rising
on the tips of their tails, coiling and uncoiling,
balancing this way and that. They were the
most graceful and beautiful of all the snakes,
and the guests applauded them wildly.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flamingoes were the only ones who
seemed not to be having a good time. Stupid
birds that they were, they had not thought
of any costumes at all. They came with the
plain white legs they had at that time and the
thick, twisted bills they have even now.
Naturally they were envious of all the gowns
they saw, but most of all, of the fancy dress of
the coral snakes. Every time one of these
went by them, courtesying, pirouetting, balancing,
the flamingoes writhed with jealousy.
For no one, meanwhile, was asking them to
dance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know what we must do,” said one of the
flamingoes at last. “We must go and get
some stockings for our legs&mdash;pink, black and
white like the coral snakes themselves&mdash;then
they will all fall in love with us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The whole flock of them took wing immediately
and flew across the river to a village
nearby. They went to the store and knocked:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tan! Tan! Tan!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who is it?” called the storekeeper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’re the flamingoes. We have come to
get some stockings&mdash;pink, black, and white.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you crazy?” the storekeeper answered.
“I keep stockings for people, not for silly
birds. Besides, stockings of such colors! You
won’t find any in town, either!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The flamingoes went on to another store:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tan! Tan! Tan! We are looking for stockings&mdash;pink,
black and white. Have you any?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pink, black and white stockings! Don’t
you know decent people don’t wear such
things? You must be crazy! Who are you,
anyway?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We are the flamingoes,” the flamingoes
replied.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that case you are silly flamingoes!
Better go somewhere else!”</p>

<p class='c007'>They went to still a third store:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tan! Tan! Pink, black and white stockings!
Got any?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pink, black and white nonsense!” called
the storekeeper. “Only birds with big noses
like yours could ask for such a thing. Don’t
make tracks on my floor!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the man swept them into the street
with a broom.</p>

<p class='c007'>So the flamingoes went from store to store,
and everywhere people called them silly, stupid
birds.</p>

<p class='c007'>However, an owl, a mischievous <i>tatu</i>, who
had just been down to the river to get some
water, and had heard all about the ball and
the flamingoes, met them on his way back and
thought he would have some fun with them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good evening, good evening, flamingoes,”
he said, making a deep bow, though, of course,
it was just to ridicule the foolish birds. “I
know what you are looking for. I doubt if
you can get any such stockings in town. You
might find them in Buenos Aires; but you
would have to order them by mail. My
sister-in-law, the barn owl, has stockings like
that, however. Why don’t you go around and
see her? She can give you her own and
borrow others from her family.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks! Thanks, ever so much!” said
the flamingoes; and they flew off to the cellar
of a barn where the barn owl lived.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tan! Tan! Good evening, Mrs. Owl,”
they said. “A relation of yours, Mr. Tatu,
advised us to call on you. Tonight, as you
know, the snakes are giving a costume ball,
and we have no costumes. If you could lend
us your pink, black and white stockings, the
coral snakes would be sure to fall in love with
us!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pleased to accommodate you,” said the
barn owl. “Will you wait just a moment?”</p>

<p class='c007'>She flew away and was gone some time.
When she came back she had the stockings
with her. But they were not real stockings.
They were nothing but skins from coral
snakes which the owl had caught and eaten
during the previous days.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps these will do,” she remarked.
“But if you wear them at the ball, I advise
you to do strictly as I say: dance all night
long, and don’t stop a moment. For if
you do, you will get into trouble, I assure
you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The flamingoes listened to what she said;
but, stupidly, did not try to guess what she
could have meant by such counsel. They saw
no danger in the pretty stockings. Delightedly
they doubled up their claws like fists,
stuck them through the snakeskins, which
were like so many long rubber tubes, and
flew back as quickly as they could to the ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the guests at the dance saw the
flamingoes in such handsome stockings, they
were as jealous as could be. You see, the
coral snakes were the lions of the evening,
and after the flamingoes came back, they
would dance with no one but the flamingoes.
Remembering the instructions of the barn
owl, the flamingoes kept their feet going all
the time, and the snakes could not see very
clearly just what those wonderful stockings
were.</p>

<p class='c007'>After a time, however, they grew suspicious.
When a flamingo came dancing by, the snakes
would get down off the ends of their tails to
examine its feet more closely. The coral
snakes, more than anybody else, began to
get uneasy. They could not take their eyes
off those stockings, and they got as near as
they could, trying to touch the legs of the
flamingoes with the tips of their tongues&mdash;for
snakes use their tongues to feel with, much as
people use their hands. But the flamingoes
kept dancing and dancing all the while,
though by this time they were getting so tired
they were about ready to give up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The coral snakes understood that sooner
or later the flamingoes would have to stop.
So they borrowed the lightning bugs from
the frogs, to be ready when the flamingoes fell
from sheer exhaustion.</p>

<p class='c007'>And in fact, it was not long before one of
the birds, all tired out, tripped over the cigar
in an alligator’s mouth, and fell down on her
side. The coral snakes all ran toward her
with their lanterns, and held the lightning
bugs up so close that they could see the feet
of the flamingo as clearly as could be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Aha! Aha! Stockings, eh? Stockings,
eh?” The coral snakes began to hiss so loudly
that people could hear them on the other side
of the Parana.</p>

<p class='c007'>The cry was taken up by all the snakes:
“They are not wearing stockings! We know
what they have done! The flamingoes have
been killing brothers of ours, and they are
wearing their skins as stockings! Those
pretty legs each stand for the murder of a
coral snake!”</p>

<p class='c007'>At this uproar, the flamingoes took fright
and tried to fly away. But they were so
tired from all the dancing that not one of
them could move a wing. The coral snakes
darted upon them, and began to bite at their
legs, tearing off the false stockings bit by
bit, and, in their rage, sinking their fangs
deep into the feet and legs of the flamingoes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flamingoes, terrified and mad with
pain, hopped this way and that, trying to
shake their enemies off. But the snakes did
not let go till every last shred of stocking had
been torn away. Then they crawled off, to
rearrange their gauze costumes that had been
much rumpled in the fray. They did not try
to kill the flamingoes then and there; for
most coral snakes are poisonous; and they
were sure the birds they had bitten would die
sooner or later anyway.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the flamingoes did not die. They
hopped down to the river and waded out into
the water to relieve their pain. Their feet and
legs, which had been white before, had now
turned red from the poison in the bites. They
stood there for days and days, trying to cool
the burning ache, and hoping to wash out the
red.</p>

<div id='il3' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic004'>
<img src='images/illus-003.jpg' alt='' class='ig004' />
<p>“The flamingoes ... hopped down to the river, and waded out ... to relieve their pain.”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>But they did not succeed. And they have
not succeeded yet. The flamingoes still pass
most of their time standing on their red legs
out in the water. Occasionally they go ashore
and walk up and down for a few moments to
see if they are getting well. But the pain
comes again at once, and they hurry back
into the water. Even there they sometimes
feel an ache in one of their feet; and they lift
it out to warm it in their feathers. They stand
that way on one leg for hours, I suppose because
the other one is so stiff and lame.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is why the flamingoes have red legs
instead of white. And the fishes know it too.
They keep coming up to the top of the water
and crying “Red legs! Red legs! Red legs!”
to make fun of the flamingoes for having tried
to borrow costumes for a ball. On that
account, the flamingoes are always at war
with the fishes. As they wade up and down,
and a fish comes up too close in order to
shout “Red legs” at them, they dip their
long bills down and catch it if they can.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='st7' class='c011'>THE LAZY BEE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>In a beehive once there was a bee who would
not work. She would go flying from blossom
to blossom on the orange trees sucking out
all the honey. But instead of taking it back
to the hive she would eat it then and there.</p>

<p class='c007'>She was a lazy bee. Every morning, the
moment the sun had warmed the hive, she
would come to the door and look out. On
making sure that it was a lovely day, she
would wash her face and comb her hair with
her paws, the way flies do, and then go flitting
off, as pleased as could be at the bright
weather. So she would go buzzing and buzzing
from flower to flower; and then after a
time she would go back and see what the
other bees were doing in the hive. So it
would go on all day long.</p>

<p class='c007'>Meantime the other bees would be working
themselves to death trying to fill the hive
full of honey; for honey is what they give
the little bees to eat as soon as they are born.
And these worker bees, very staid, respectable,
earnest bees, began to scowl at the conduct of
this shirker of a sister they had.</p>

<p class='c007'>You must know that, at the door of every
beehive, there are always a number of bees
on watch, to see that no insects but bees get
into the hive. These policemen, as a rule,
are old bees, with a great deal of experience
in life. Their backs are quite bald, because
all the hair gets worn off from rubbing
against the hive as they walk in and out of
the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day when the lazy bee was just dropping
in to see what was going on in the hive, these
policemen called her to one side:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sister,” said they, “it is time you did a
little work. All us bees have to work!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The little bee was quite scared when the
policemen spoke to her, but she answered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I go flying about all day long, and get
very tired!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t ask you how tired you got!
We want to see how much work you can do!
This is Warning Number 1!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And they let her go on into the hive.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the lazy little bee did not mend her
ways. On the next evening the policemen
stopped her again:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sister, we didn’t see you working today!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The little bee was expecting something of
the kind, and she had been thinking up what
she would say all the way home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go to work one of these days,” she
spoke up promptly; and with a cheerful,
winsome smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We don’t want you to go to work one of
these days,” they answered gruffly. “We
want you to go to work tomorrow morning.
This is Warning Number 2!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And they let her in.</p>

<p class='c007'>The following night, when the lazy bee
came home, she did not wait for the policemen
to stop her. She went up to them sorrowfully
and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, yes! I remember what I promised.
I’m so sorry I wasn’t able to work today!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t ask how sorry you were, nor
what you had promised. What we want
from you is work. Today is the nineteenth
of April. Tomorrow will be the twentieth
of April. See to it that the twentieth of
April does not pass without your putting at
least one load of honey into the hive. This is
Warning Number 3! You may enter!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the policemen who had been blocking
the door stepped aside to let her in.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lazy bee woke up with very good intentions
the next morning; but the sun was
so warm and bright and the flowers were so
beautiful! The day passed the same as all
the others; except that toward evening the
weather changed. The sun went down behind
a great bank of clouds and a strong icy wind
began to blow.</p>

<p class='c007'>The lazy little bee started for home as fast
as she could, thinking how warm and cozy it
would be inside the hive, with all that storm
blowing out of doors. But on the porch of the
beehive the policemen got in front of her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are you going, young lady?” said
they.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am going in to bed. This is where I
live!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You must be mistaken,” said the policemen.
“Only busy worker bees live here!
Lazy bees are not allowed inside this door!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tomorrow, surely, surely, surely, I am
going to work,” said the little bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There is no tomorrow for lazy bees,” said
the policemen; for they were old, wise bees,
and knew philosophy. “Away with you!”
And they pushed her off the doorstep.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little bee did not know what to do.
She flew around for a time; but soon it began
to grow dark; the wind blew colder and
colder, and drops of rain began to fall. Quite
tired at last, she took hold of a leaf, intending
to rest a moment; but she was chilled and
numbed by the cold. She could not hang
on, and fell a long distance to the ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>She tried to get to her wings again, but
they were too tired to work. So she started
crawling over the ground toward the hive.
Every stone, every stick she met, she had to
climb over with great effort&mdash;so many hills
and mountains they seemed to such a tiny
bee. The raindrops were coming faster when,
almost dead with cold and fright and fatigue,
she arrived at the door of the hive.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, oh,” she moaned. “I am cold, and it
is going to rain! I shall be sure to die out
here!” And she crept up to the door.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the fierce policemen again stopped her
from going in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Forgive me, sisters,” the little bee said.
“Please, let me go in!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too late! Too late!” they answered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, sisters, I am so sleepy!” said the
little bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too late! Too late!” said they.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, sisters, I am cold!” said the little
bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sorry! You can’t go in!” said they.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please, sisters, for one last time! I shall
die out here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won’t die, lazy bee! One night will
teach you the value of a warm bed earned by
honest labor! Away from here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And they pushed her off the doorstep
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time it was raining hard. The
little bee felt her wings and fur getting wetter
and wetter; and she was so cold and sleepy
she did not know what to do. She crawled
along as fast as she could over the ground,
hoping to come to some place where it was
dry and not so cold. At last she came to a
tree and began to walk up the trunk.
Suddenly, just as she had come to the crotch
of two branches, she fell! She fell a long, long
distance and landed finally on something
soft. There was no wind and no rain blowing.
On coming to her wits the little bee understood
that she had fallen down through a hole inside
a hollow tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now the little bee had the fright of her
life. Coiled up near her there was a snake, a
green snake with a brick-colored back. That
hollow tree was the snake’s house; and the
snake lay there looking at her with eyes that
shone even in that darkness. Now, snakes
eat bees, and like them. So when this little
bee found herself so close to a fearful enemy of
her kind, she just closed her eyes and murmured
to herself:</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is the last of me! Oh, how I wish I
had worked!”</p>

<p class='c007'>To her great surprise, however, the
snake not only did not eat her, but spoke
to her rather softly for such a terrible
snake:</p>

<p class='c007'>“How do you do, little bee? You must be
a naughty little bee, to be out so late at
night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” she murmured, her heart in her
throat. “I have been a naughty bee. I did
not work, and they won’t let me in to go to
my bed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that case, I shall not be so sorry to
eat you!” answered the snake. “Surely there
can be no harm at all in depriving the world
of a useless little bee like you! I won’t have
to go out for dinner tonight. I shall eat
you right here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The little bee was about as scared as a bee
can be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is not fair,” she said. “It is not
just! You have no right to eat me just because
you are bigger than I am. Go and ask people
if that isn’t so! People know what is right
and wrong!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, ah!” said the snake, lifting his head
higher, “so you have a good opinion of men?
So you think that the men who steal your
honey are more honest than snakes who eat
you? You are not only a lazy bee. You are
also a silly one!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not because men are dishonest that
they take our honey,” said the bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why is it then?” said the snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s because they are more intelligent
than we are!” That is what the bee said;
but the snake just laughed; and then he
hissed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if you must have it that way, it’s
because I’m more intelligent than you that
I’m going to eat you now! Get ready to be
eaten, lazy bee!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the snake drew back to strike, and lap
up the bee at one gobble.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the little bee had time to say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s because you’re duller than I am that
you eat me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Duller than you?” asked the snake, letting
his head down again. “How is that,
stupid?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“However it is, it’s so!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to be shown!” said the snake.
“I will make a bargain with you. We will
each do a trick; and the cleverest trick wins.
If I win, I’ll eat you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I win?” asked the little bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If you win,” said the snake after some
thought, “you may stay in here where it is
warm all night. Is it a bargain?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” said the bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>The snake considered another moment or
so and then began to laugh. He had thought
of something a bee could not possibly do. He
darted out of a hole in the tree so quickly the
bee had scarcely time to wonder what he was
up to; and just as quickly he came back with
a seed pod from the eucalyptus tree that
stood near the beehive and shaded it on days
when the sun was hot. Now the seed pods
of the eucalyptus tree are just the shape of a
top; in fact, the boys and girls in Argentina
call them “tops”&mdash;<i>trompitos!</i></p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you just watch and see what I’m
a-going to do,” said the snake. “Watch
now! Watch!...”</p>

<p class='c007'>The snake wound the thin part of his tail
around the top like a string; then, with a jump
forward to his full length, he straightened his
tail out. The “top” began to spin like mad
on the bark floor there at the bottom of the
hollow tree; and it spun and spun and spun,
dancing, jumping, running off in this direction
and then in that direction. And the snake
laughed! And he laughed and he laughed and
he laughed! No bee would ever be able to do
a thing like that!</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally the top got tired of spinning and
fell over on its side.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That is very clever!” said the bee, “I
could never do that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“In that case, I shall have to eat you!”
said the snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not just yet, please,” said the bee. “I
can’t spin a top; but I can do something no
one else can do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is that?” asked the snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can disappear!” said the bee.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What do you mean, disappear?” said
the snake, with some interest. “Disappear so
that I can’t see you and without going away
from here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without going away from here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without hiding in the ground?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Without hiding in the ground!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I give up!” said the snake.
“Disappear! But if you don’t do as you say, I eat
you, gobble, gobble, just like that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Now you must know that while the top was
spinning round and round, the little bee
had noticed something on the floor of the
hollow tree she had not seen before: it was a
little shrub, three or four inches high, with
leaves about the size of a fifty-cent piece. She
now walked over to the stem of this little
shrub, taking care, however, not to touch it
with her body. Then she said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now it is my turn, Mr. Snake. Won’t
you be so kind as to turn around, and count
‘one,’ ‘two,’ ‘three.’ At the word ‘three,’
you can look for me everywhere! I simply
won’t be around!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The snake looked the other way and ran off
a “onetathree,” then turning around with
his mouth wide open to have his dinner at last.
You see, he counted so fast just to give the
bee as little time as possible, under the contract
they had made.</p>

<p class='c007'>But if he opened his mouth wide for his
dinner, he held it open in complete surprise.
There was no bee to be found anywhere! He
looked on the floor. He looked on the sides
of the hollow tree. He looked in each nook
and cranny. He looked the little shrub all
over. Nothing! The bee had simply disappeared!</p>

<p class='c007'>Now, the snake understood that if his trick
of spinning the top with his tail was extraordinary,
this trick of the bee was almost
miraculous. Where had that good-for-nothing
lazybones gone to? Here? No! There? No!
Where then? Nowhere! There was no way to
find the little bee!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” said the snake at last, “I give up!
Where are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>A little voice seemed to come from a long
way off, but still from the middle of the space
inside the hollow tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won’t eat me if I reappear?” it said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I won’t eat you!” said the snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Promise?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I promise! But where are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here I am,” said the bee, coming out on
one of the leaves of the little shrub.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was not such a great mystery after all.
That shrub was a Sensitive-plant, a plant
that is very common in South America, especially
in the North of the Republic of Argentina,
where Sensitive-plants grow to quite a
good size. The peculiarity of the Sensitive-plant
is that it shrivels up its leaves at the
slightest contact. The leaves of this shrub were
unusually large, as is true of the Sensitive-plants
around the city of Misiones. You see,
the moment the bee lighted on a leaf, it folded
up tight about her, hiding her completely
from view. Now, the snake had been living
next to that plant all the season long, and had
never noticed anything unusual about it.
The little bee had paid attention to such
things, however; and her knowledge this
time had saved her life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The snake was very much ashamed at being
bested by such a little bee; and he was not
very nice about it either. So much so, in
fact, that the bee spent most of the night
reminding him of the promise he had made
not to eat her.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it was a long, endless night for the
little bee. She sat on the floor in one corner
and the snake coiled up in the other corner
opposite. Pretty soon it began to rain so
hard that the water came pouring in through
the hole at the top of the tree and made quite
a puddle on the floor. The bee sat there and
shivered and shivered; and every so often
the snake would raise his head as though to
swallow her at one gulp. “You promised!
You promised! You promised!” And the
snake would lower his head, sheepishlike,
because he did not want the bee to think him
a dishonest, as well as a stupid snake.</p>

<p class='c007'>The little bee, who had been used to a
warm hive at home and to warm sunlight out
of doors, had never dreamed there could be
so much cold anywhere as there was in that
hollow tree. Nor had there ever been a
night so long!</p>

<p class='c007'>But the moment there was a trace of daylight
at the hole in the top of the tree, the bee
bade the snake good-by and crawled out.
She tried her wings; and this time they
worked all right. She flew in a bee-line
straight for the door of the hive.</p>

<p class='c007'>The policemen were standing there and she
began to cry. But they simply stepped aside
without saying a word, and let her in. They
understood, you see, as wise old bees, that
this wayward child was not the lazy bee they
had driven away the evening before, but a
sadder and wiser child who now knew something
about the world she had to live in.</p>

<p class='c007'>And they were right. Never before was
there such a bee for working from morning
till night, day in, day out, gathering pollen
and honey from the flowers. When Autumn
came she was the most respected bee in the
hive and she was appointed teacher of the
young bees who would do the work the following
year. And her first lesson was something
like this:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not because bees are intelligent but
because they work that makes them such
wonderful little things. I used my intelligence
only once&mdash;and that was to save my
life. I should not have gotten into that
trouble, however, if I had worked, like all
the other bees. I used to waste my strength
just flying around doing nothing. I should
not have been any more tired if I had worked.
What I needed was a sense of duty; and I
got it that night I spent with the snake in the
hollow tree.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Work, my little bees, work!&mdash;remembering
that what we are all working for, the happiness
of everybody, will be hard enough to get
if each of us does his full duty. This is what
people say, and it is just as true of bees.
Work well and faithfully and you will be
happy. There is no sounder philosophy for
a man or for a bee!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 id='st8' class='c011'>THE GIANT TORTOISE’S GOLDEN RULE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Once there was a man who lived in Buenos
Aires and was a friend of the superintendent
of the Zoo. This man had a very happy life,
because he worked hard and enjoyed good
health. But one day he fell ill, and the
doctors told him he would never get well
unless he left town and went to live in the
country where there was good air and a warm
climate. The man could not think of such a
thing, however. He had five little brothers,
and both his parents were dead. He had to
provide the little boys with food and clothes,
and get them ready for school in the morning.
Who would care for them, if he went away?
So he kept on with his work and his illness
grew worse and worse.</p>

<p class='c007'>One day a man from the Zoo met him on the
street and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ought to go and live an out-of-door
life for a while. Now, I have an idea. We
need a collection of new specimens for our
museum, and you are a good shot with a gun.
Wouldn’t you like to go up into the Andes
and hunt for us? I will pay for your outfit,
and get a woman to look after your little
brothers. It will not cost you very much,
and there will be plenty of money left for the
boys.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The sick man gladly accepted. He went
off to the mountains, many, many miles
beyond Misiones, where he camped in the
open air and soon began to get better.</p>

<p class='c007'>He lived quite by himself, doing his own
cooking, washing his own clothes, and making
his own bed, which was a bag with blankets in
it. He did not use a tent, but slept in the
bag out under the stars. When it rained he
would throw up a shelter of branches, cover
it with his waterproof, and sit down all cozy
underneath, till the storm cleared. He ate
partridges and venison, with the berries and
wild fruits he found along the mountains.
Whenever he saw some rare animal that the
Zoo would want, he shot it, and dried its skin
in the sun. In course of time, he made a big
bundle of such skins, which he carried on his
shoulder whenever he moved his camp to a
new place. Many beautifully spotted snakes
he was able to catch alive; and these he kept
in a big hollow gourd&mdash;for in South America
wild squashes and pumpkins grow till they
are as large as gasoline cans.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this was very hard work but the man
grew strong and healthy again. And what an
appetite he had when supper time came
around! One day when his provisions were
getting low, he went out hunting with his
gun. Soon he came to a wide lake, and what
should he see on the shore but a huge panther
that had caught a tortoise! The fierce animal
had drawn the turtle up out of the water and
was clawing between the two shells trying to
scratch the meat out. As the man approached,
the panther turned and, with a great roar,
leaped toward him. The panther was not
quick enough, however, for a bullet from the
man’s rifle caught him between the eyes and
laid him low in his tracks.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What a wonderful rug this skin will make
for somebody!” the man exclaimed; and he
carefully removed the hide and rolled it up to
take home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I will have turtle soup for supper
tonight,” the man continued as he turned
toward the tortoise; for turtle-flesh is one of
the richest and sweetest of all meats.</p>

<p class='c007'>But he could not help feeling very sorry for
the poor turtle when he saw what a plight she
was in. The panther’s claws had torn the flesh
terribly; and a great gash in her throat had
all but left her head severed from the rest of
the body. Instead of killing the wounded
turtle the hunter thought he would try to
cure her of her hurts.</p>

<div id='il4' class='figcenter'>
<div class='ic005'>
<img src='images/illus-004.jpg' alt='' class='ig005' />
<p>“He could not help feeling sorry for the poor turtle....”</p>
</div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>The camp was some distance away and the
man was very tired. Besides, when he tried
to lift the tortoise, he found she weighed nearly
two hundred pounds. Finally he put a rope
around her, and pulled and hauled till he
dragged her along over the grass back to the
camp.</p>

<p class='c007'>The man had no extra pieces of cloth to
make a bandage with, so he cut off a piece of
his shirt and took the lining out of his coat.
Finally he managed to bind up the tortoise’s
throat and stop the bleeding. Then he
pushed her into a corner of the shelter, where
she lay motionless for days and days. Twice
a day the man would come and wash the
wound with water and liniment. When he
thought the cut had healed, he took off the
wrapping and the tortoise drew her head into
her shell. The man kept visiting her every
morning, however, tapping gently on the
turtle’s back to wake her up.</p>

<p class='c007'>The tortoise got entirely well; but then
something terrible happened. The man
caught a fever in the swamps around the lake,
and chills and pains began to wrack his body.
One morning he could not get out of his sleeping
bag, but just lay there groaning. His
fever got rapidly worse, and a parching thirst
burned at his throat. In his delirium he
began to talk out loud: “Here I am all alone,
away out here in the woods. I am surely
going to die. There is no one even to bring
me a drink of water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the tortoise, all this time, had not been
sleeping so soundly as the man had thought.
In fact, she had been slyly watching him as he
worked about the camp. When the hunter
did not get up that morning, the tortoise
understood that something was wrong, and
also that it was water he kept calling for.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This man,” thought the tortoise, “did
not eat me that day, though he had me in his
power and was hungry. Instead, he took
care of me till I was well. A good tortoise
ought surely to do as much for him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The big turtle&mdash;she stood as high as a
chair and weighed, as I said, as much as a
man&mdash;crawled off to the lakeside. There
she hunted around till she found a small
tortoise shell. She polished it with sand
till it was bright and shiny. Then she filled
it with pure cold water from a spring, crawled
back to camp with it, and gave the man a
drink.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now for something to eat,” said the
turtle.</p>

<p class='c007'>Turtles know the most peculiar kinds of
roots and grasses to eat when they are sick.
This tortoise went out and gathered a supply
of such herbs and fed them to the man; and
he ate them without noticing who was finding
his food for him, so nearly unconscious was he
in his delirium. So day after day the tortoise
went hunting and hunting over the mountain
sides, looking for tenderer and tenderer grasses
with stronger and stronger juices. And how
sorry she was she could not climb trees where
such fine berries and fruits were hanging!</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus the hunter lay for a week or more,
struggling between life and death and kept
alive only by the herbs the tortoise brought
him. And then one day, to the joy of the
faithful animal, the man sat up in his sleeping
bag. The fever had left him and his mind
was clear. He looked around in surprise to
see the water and a bundle of grasses near
him; for he was quite alone, save for the big
turtle that still seemed to be sleeping in her
corner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alas, I am lost!” he moaned. “No one
will ever come to me. The fever will return,
and I cannot get any medicine nearer than
Buenos Aires. If I could walk, I might get
there; but I can’t, so I must die!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And, just as he feared, the fever did return
that evening worse than before; and the man
fell back into unconsciousness.</p>

<p class='c007'>But again the turtle had understood: “Yes,
he will die, if he stays here! I must get him to
Buenos Aires where there is some medicine!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Carefully she dragged the bundle of skins
up to the man and placed it in position on his
body. Then she did the same with the gourd
full of snakes. And what a task it was to
get the gun in place on top of the whole pile!
Finally she went out into the woods and bit
off a number of tough, strong vines. These
she stretched across the sleeping man and
tied to his arms and legs in such a way as
to keep the baggage from falling off. She
dug her way under the sleeping bag till everything
was balanced on her back; and then
she started off toward Buenos Aires.</p>

<p class='c007'>She crawled along for ten or twelve hours
each day, swimming rivers and ponds, sinking
deep into the mud of bogs, climbing hills and
crossing sandy plains where the sun at midday
scorched terribly. In his fever the man
kept calling for water; and it was very trying
to the poor tortoise to have to get the man off
her back each time while she went looking for
a drink for him. But she struggled forward
just the same, and each night she knew she
was that much nearer to Buenos Aires.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the tortoise, after days and days of this
toil, understood that her own strength was
giving out. She did not complain, but she
began to be afraid that she would die before
getting the hunter to a place of safety. And
one morning, in fact, she was so tired she was
quite unable to move.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here I am dying all alone in the woods!”
the man moaned from his bag. “No one
will help me get to Buenos Aires! Oh, oh, I
shall die here all alone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>You see, the man had been unconscious all
the time, and thought he was still lying in the
shelter, away back in the mountains.</p>

<p class='c007'>The words stirred the weary tortoise to
fresh effort. She got the man up on her back
again and went on.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the moment came when she could not
take another step forward. She had not been
eating for some days, because she had not
dared take the time for hunting. Now she
was too weak to do even that. So she drew
her legs into her shell and closed her eyes,
waiting for death to come, and mourning
inside her turtle-heart that she had failed in
saving the life of the man who had befriended
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun went down and night fell. As the
turtle chanced to open her eyes, she was surprised
to see a reddish glow on the distant horizon;
and she heard a voice&mdash;the voice of a wharf
rat&mdash;talking near by. The rat was saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My, what a turtle, what a turtle! I
never saw such a big one in my life! And
what is that on her back? A cord of wood?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The poor turtle did not know that those
lights came from Buenos Aires, and that the
rat was a citizen of that town, out for a night’s
foraging in the fields of the suburbs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is not a cord of wood,” the turtle
murmured, “It is a man, a sick man!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what on earth are you doing here
with a man on your back?” the rat inquired,
laughing the way rats from the city laugh at
their country cousins.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I ... I was ...” the tortoise murmured
faintly, “I was taking him to Buenos
Aires to be cured ... but I shall never get
there.... My strength has given out....
I am going to die ... we are both going to
die, right here!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never saw such a silly turtle!” the rat
replied. “Don’t you know you’re in Buenos
Aires now? Don’t you see those lights?
They’re from the theater district. Go along
straight ahead; and you’ll get there in no
time!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This encouraging news filled the tortoise
with new life. She strained every muscle
inside her shell and moved slowly but surely
forward.</p>

<p class='c007'>When it was daylight she found herself
quite inside the town. And who should come
along the street but the superintendent of the
Zoo!</p>

<p class='c007'>“My, what a turtle! What a big turtle!”
he exclaimed. “And what in the world is
she carrying on her back?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The tortoise could not speak from sheer
fatigue. She stopped, and the man came
up to examine the strange outfit on her back.
To his amazement, he recognized his friend in
the man sleeping, pale and fever-stricken,
inside the bag. He called a carriage and got
the man home, sending for a doctor to come
at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>In course of time, the man got well. When
he learned that the tortoise had brought him
miles and miles on her back, all the way from
the Andes to Buenos Aires, he could hardly
believe the story. And out of gratitude he
said he would make a home for her the rest of
her life. His own cottage was quite filled with
his six little brothers; and there was no room
for such a big pet in the house. But the
director of the Zoo said he would find a place
for her there, and care for her as tenderly as
he would for his own daughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>And that is what happened. The tortoise
was given a house for herself alone, with a
tank of water in the front yard, where she
could swim if she wanted to. She was allowed
to wander at will over all the gardens of the
Zoo, though she spent a large part of her time
near the monkey house, where there was most
to eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>And she is still living there. Go to the
zoölogical park any day and you will see an
enormously big tortoise crawling slowly along
over the green grass. If you wait long enough
you will see a man come up, stoop over and
rap gently with his knuckles on her shell.</p>

<p class='c007'>That’s the tortoise we have been talking
about&mdash;and that’s the man!</p>
